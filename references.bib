This article challenges the current conception and measurement of ``diversity'' and invites scholars to rethink ``social capital'' in complex societies. It reproduces the analysis of Putnam and shows that the association between diversity and self-reported trust is a compositional artifact attributable to residential sorting: nonwhites report lower trust and are overrepresented in heterogeneous communities. The association between diversity and trust is better explained by differences between communities and their residents in terms of race/ethnicity, residential stability, and economic conditions; these classic indicators of inequality, not diversity, strongly and consistently predict self-reported trust. Diversity indexes also obscure the distinction between in-group and out-group contact. For whites, heterogeneity means more out-group neighbors; for nonwhites, heterogeneity means more in-group neighbors. Theref...},

This has always been true and it is, if anything, more true today than in the past. The culture war is almost entirely an elite phenomenon, driven by a small group of activists on the left and right who exert influence far out of proportion to their numbers. It is the elites and activists who are polarized, not the public. In this study we use data from the American National Election Studies and national exit polls to test five major claims made by Fiorina about the state of public opinion in the United States. This evidence indicates that while some of the claims of culture war proponents are overstated, there are deep divisions in America between Democrats and Republicans, between red state voters and blue state voters, and between religious voters and secular voters. These divisions are not confined to a small minority of elected officials and activists{\textemdash}they involve a large segment of the public and they are likely to increase in the future as a result of long-term trends affecting American society.},

His book, The Big Sort: Why the Clustering of Like-Minded America Is Tearing Us Apart , was mentioned regularly during the presidential campaign; most notably, former president Bill Clinton urged audiences to read the book. Bishop's thesis is that Americans increasingly are choosing to live in neighborhoods populated with people just like themselves. In turn, these residential choices have produced a significant increase in geographic political polarization. Bishop does not contend that people consciously decide to live with fellow Democrats or Republicans; rather political segregation is a byproduct of the correlations between political views and the various demographic and life-style indicators people consider when making residential decisions. Whatever the cause, Bishop contends that the resulting geographic polarization is a troubling and dangerous development.},

These approaches are complementary rather than contradictory. What is absent thus far from the ICT debate is attention to ethnicity, except as a surrogate of economic class or in vague allusions to a digital divide. Since people use ICT to build a sense of community and personal identity, both of which relate strongly to ethnicity, the topic deserves attention. The four approaches are integrated here to understand the appropriation of the internet by temporary and permanent immigrants to the USA from India (typically called Non-Resident Indians or NRIs). The concept of virtual space can be used to organize discussion of the use of the internet by NRIs. To better encapsulate the virtual space we employ a map of what we call 'bridgespace', a virtual space that supports flows of people, goods, capital and ideas between South Asia and North America. We consider the full range of sites involved in the bridgespace, then direct our attention in particular to 'matrimonial' sites, those sites designed to support the identification of marriage partners.},

However, knowledge regarding the prevalence of race change is limited. This data visualization fills this descriptive gap by providing a comprehensive account of recent levels of racial self-identification change among Americans. The author uses five high-quality panel surveys in which race is asked of the same nationally representative adult samples several years apart. Among all respondents, race change rates range from 5 percent to 12 percent across surveys, averaging 8 percent. Original white identifiers (4 percent on average) are much less prone to change than initial nonwhites collectively (20 percent). Blacks have as stable identities as whites, while mixed-race (52 percent) and ``other''-race (73 percent) Americans undergo substantial identity shifts over time. Results further cement a perspective of race as flexible for some in the United States.},

The purpose of this research is to examine the individual and combined effects of two forms of social capital, bonding and bridging, on community action in rural  towns. Findings indicate that both bridging and bonding social capital significantly predict community action. In addition, an interaction is found that suggests that one form can make up for weaknesses in the other in communities in which both are not strong.},

The results, in line with the proposition, show that the average contribution is significantly larger in Sweden, implying a higher level of trust and cooperation in Sweden than in India.

This study differs from previous ones in that it uses a multilateral game experiment to study trust and cooperation rather than a bilateral game experiment.

But as Richard Alba and Victor Nee show in the first systematic treatment of assimilation since the mid-1960s, it continues to shape the immigrant experience, even though the geography of immigration has shifted from Europe to Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Institutional changes, from civil rights legislation to immigration law, have provided a more favorable environment for nonwhite immigrants and their children than in the past. Assimilation is still driven, in claim, by the decisions of immigrants and the second generation to improve their social and material circumstances in America. But they also show that immigrants, historically and today, have profoundly changed our mainstream society and culture in the process of becoming Americans. Surveying a variety of domains--language, socioeconomic attachments, residential patterns, and intermarriage--they demonstrate the continuing importance of assimilation in American life. And they predict that it will blur the boundaries among the major, racially defined populations, as nonwhites and Hispanics are increasingly incorporated into the mainstream.

Evolving from the ideas sketched by Steven Vertovec in his famous 2007 essay, the concept as deployed in research has become a successor to multiculturalism. The super-diversity lens has trained attention on horizontal processes of ``living together'' in very diverse settings, like some urban neighbourhoods where no group holds the majority status. However, we argue here that for a fuller understanding of integration, we need the vertical dimension of social power. This dimension is manifest through the mainstream, which permeates many institutions (including local ones such as schools) and becomes visible in the cultural adjustments made by members of immigrant-origin minorities, particularly among those who aspire to social mobility. The power axis represented by the mainstream is not strictly dependent on the demographic distribution of ethnic groups, given that white natives re...},

Specific objectives include assessing how the factors identified in Michael Porter's "diamond" support the green building industry cluster in this region, describing the trends in terms of growth and expansion in the sector, and, where possible, providing quantitative data to document the impact of this industry cluster. The authors suggest that Portland has a robust and competitive green building cluster that is supported by many of the elements described in Porter's diamond--local and export demand, a critical mass of leading-edge firms, strong supporting institutions, qualified employees, and a robust supply chain. The study also identifies areas in need of additional support to realize the full potential for economic development in this cluster and offers an approach to mapping the green building cluster that may also inform analysis of other emerging sustainability clusters.},

  abstract = {Performing longitudinal analysis of socio-economic change in small-area spatial units such as census tracts presents several methodological complications and requires significant data preparation. Unit boundaries are revised each census year because of changes in population and delineation methodologies. This limits cross-year comparison since data are not representative of the same spatial units. To address these problems, we have developed an innovative procedure to reduce error when comparing tract-level data across census years by apportioning data to the same areal units. This paper describes the methods used to create the Canadian Longitudinal Tract Database. Our procedure is a combination of map-matching techniques, dasymetric overlays, and population-weighted areal interpolation. The output is a set of tables with apportionment weights pertaining to pairs of unique boundary identifiers across census years, which can be linked with census data or other data with census identifiers that require longitudinal comparison.},

This study, alternatively, reveals these formations as adroitly proactive and interactively heterogeneous across their respective cities. Through a racial economy lens, we empirically examine the racial contours of this "governance heterogeneity" in one urban setting: Chicago, Illinois. In this frame, a comparative analysis of Chicago's Bronzeville and Pilsen neighborhoods is presented. Both neighborhoods are constituted by different racial profiles: Bronzeville is home to a predominantly African-American population, whereas Pilsen is mostly Mexican and Mexican-American. The study reveals that redevelopment governances are differentially responsive to established, deeply rooted racialized conceptions of "Blackness" and "Latinoness." As a result, the form and trajectory of redevelopment in both settings has unfolded in markedly different ways.},

It is increasingly acknowledged, however, that the mechanisms through which the residential context affects individual outcomes may operate at different spatial scales, ranging from the very immediate environment to the metropolitan region. We take a multi-scale approach to investigate the extent to which concentrated poverty in adolescence is related to obtained education level and income later in life, by measuring the residential context as bespoke neighbourhoods at five geographical scales that range from areas encompassing the 200 nearest neighbours to areas that include the 200k+ nearest neighbours. We use individual-level geocoded longitudinal register data from Sweden and the Netherlands to follow 15/16-year-olds until they are 30 years old. The findings show that the contextual effects on education are very similar in both countries. Living in a poor area as a teenager is related to a lower obtained educational level when people are in their late 20s. This relationship, however, is stronger for lower spatial scales. We also find effects of contextual poverty on income in both countries. Overall, this effect is stronger in the Netherlands than in Sweden. Partly, this is related to differences in spatial structure. If only individuals in densely populated areas in Sweden are considered, effects on income are similar across the two countries and income effects are more stable across spatial scales. Overall, we find important evidence that the scalar properties of neighbourhood effects differ across life-course outcomes.},

Time varying Granger causality is investigated through application of the Markov Switching Vector Autoregression of Psaradakis, Ravn, and Sola [Journal of Applied Econometrics, 20(5), 665-683 (2005)]. The results show that the real price of oil helps forecast unemployment in recessions only, while the real interest rate does so exclusively in expansions. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that oil prices have asymmetric effects on the economy. A further result is that oil, but not the real rate, is economically significant for unemployment in the long run solution of the model.},

In this paper, the utility of spatial data analytical methods such as exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) is suggested as a means to leverage the information contained in social indicator databases. The principles underlying ESDA are illustrated using a study of clusters and outliers based on data for a child risk scale computed for countries in the state of Virginia. Evidence of spatial clusters of high child risks is obtained along the Southern region of Virginia. The utility of spatial methods for state agencies in monitoring social indicators at various localities is discussed. A six-step framework that integrates spatial analysis of key indicators within a monitoring framework is presented; we argue that such a framework could be useful in enhancing communication between State and local planners.},

Agent-based computational economics enables us to ask a wider question: how agents' actions, strategies, or expectations might react to{\textemdash}might endogenously change with{\textemdash}the patterns they create. In other words, it enables us to examine how the economy behaves out of equilibrium, when it is not at a steady state. This out-of-equilibrium approach is not a minor adjunct to standard economic theory; it is economics done in a more general way. When examined out of equilibrium, economic patterns sometimes simplify into a simple, homogeneous equilibrium of standard economics; but just as often they show perpetually novel and complex behavior. The static equilibrium approach suffers two characteristic indeterminacies: it cannot easily resolve among multiple equilibria; nor can it easily model individuals' choices of expectations. Both problems are ones of formation (of an equilibrium and of an ``ecology'' of expectations, respectively), and when analyzed in formation{\textemdash}that is, out of equilibrium{\textemdash}these anomalies disappear.},

Rejection of this hypothesis should lead to an inter-firm analysis that identifies the relationships among firms in the region.

  abstract = {Does gentrification help or harm residential neighbourhoods and what are the implications of this evidence for current urban policies? This paper reports on a systematic review of the English-language research literature on gentrification which attempted to identify the range of costs and benefits associated with the process. It is concluded from this that existing evidence on gentrification shows it to have been largely harmful, predominantly through household displacement and community conflict. The paper then turns to the question of whether current UK urban policy developments are likely to engender gentrification. It is argued that, on the one hand, the language of gentrification processes have been used widely in regeneration policy documents to suggest positive forces for local housing and neighbourhood change. Meanwhile, policy instruments designed to deliver an urban renaissance suggest responses to the problem of gentrification in particular regional contexts and the promotion of gentrification itself in other localities. The paper concludes that the aims of an inclusive renaissance agenda appear to have been discarded in favour of policies which pursue revitalization through gentrification and displacement.},

Place effects on health emerge from complex interdependent processes in which individuals interact with each other and their environment and in which both individuals and environments adapt and change over time. Traditional epidemiologic study designs and statistical regression approaches are unable to examine these dynamic processes. These limitations have constrained the types of questions asked, the answers received, and the hypotheses and theoretical explanations that are developed. Agent-based models and other systems-dynamics models may help to address some of these challenges. Agent-based models are computer representations of systems consisting of heterogeneous microentities that can interact and change/adapt over time in response to other agents and features of the environment. Using these models, one can observe how macroscale dynamics emerge from microscale interactions and adaptations. A number of challenges and limitations exist for agent-based modeling. Nevertheless, use of these dynamic models may complement traditional epidemiologic analyses and yield additional insights into the processes involved and the interventions that may be most useful.},

We examine where Chicago-area residents would "seriously consider" and "never consider" living, finding that community attraction and avoidance are highly racialized. Race most clearly shapes the residential perceptions and preferences of whites, and matters the least to blacks. Latinos would seriously consider moving to numerous neighborhoods, but controls for demographics and distance from the respondents' home make Latino preferences much like those of whites. Critically, the geography of existing segregation begets further segregation: distance from current community significantly affects perceptions of the communities into which respondents might move. While neighborhood perception may cause persistent segregation, it may also offer hope for integration with appropriate policy interventions.},

In particular, our interest lies with shrinking and at-risk-of-shrinking metropolitan and micropolitan areas and the degree to which immigrants have impacted population change. We decompose foreign-born population contributions by place of origin, linking origin and destination geographies and also focus more specifically on the connections between city-suburb growth patterns and the role of the foreign born by place of birth. We find evidence that urban population loss is accompanied by increases in the foreign born, resulting in substantial transformation of the population composition of both central cities and outlying, suburban areas. Furthermore, we find that a number of areas avoided population loss during our study period, solely through net increases in the foreign born. Our findings are important from an urban inequality standpoint, suggesting an important role for the foreign born in mediating inter-city inequality, but also highlighting the need for strong policy responses that focus on the long-term integration and provision of services for these groups in order to mitigate the potential for increased inequality within and across these areas.},

  abstract = {Segregation studies have mainly focused on urban structures as a whole or have discussed specific (gentrifying or renewing) neighbourhoods. The literature suggests that changes in segregation occur primarily through selective migration. In this paper, we follow up on recent work that has questioned these orthodoxies, suggesting that in situ social mobility, and entries to and exits from the city population should be taken into account as well, and that dynamics in all neighbourhoods should be considered. The paper traces the processes by which segregation changes for the cities of Amsterdam and The Hague for 1999{\textendash}2006, using a longitudinal individual-level database covering the entire population. It extends previous work by looking at income rather than socio-economic status and by drilling down to the neighbourhood level. Applying an existing measure of segregation (Delta) in a novel way, the analysis focuses on changes in the spatial distribution of household income, measuring the relative contribution of a range of processes to changes in segregation. Results show that segregation rises in both cities but that different processes drive changes in each case. Furthermore, the aggregate change in segregation for each city masks a diversity of changes at the neighbourhood level, some of which tend to increase segregation while others tend to reduce it. Mapping these changes and the individual processes contributing to them shows that they have a distinct geography, which seems to be structured by historically specific trends in state and housing market context. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors.

  abstract = {Objective To assess whether an indicator of structural racism{\textemdash}the legacy of slavery{\textemdash}impacts racial inequality in poverty among individuals within the same family structure. Background Family structure is a dominant explanation for racial inequality in poverty. This overemphasis on an ``individual-level'' variable results in relatively less attention to the role of structural factors. Yet, structural factors, like the legacy of slavery, may be key to understanding how race and family structure intersect in the context of poverty. Method The authors use data from the Luxembourg Income Study, the American Community Survey, and the Historical 1860 Census. Multilevel models link individual- and state-level data and separate models focus on counties. The authors assess whether a proxy of the legacy of slavery (i.e., the historical concentration of enslaved people in 1860) relates to Black{\textendash}White inequality in poverty among single mother households and among married with children households in the US South. Results There is an impact of the legacy of slavery on Black{\textendash}White inequality in poverty even within-family type, but the legacy of slavery appears to be more consequential for married with children households than single mother households. Among married parent households, the racial gap in poverty is more pronounced where the legacy of slavery is stronger. Conclusion Results suggest the link between family structure and racial inequality in poverty is overstated and more indirect, operating{\textemdash}at least partially{\textemdash}through structural racism. Implications This study challenges the perception of marriage as an anti-poverty mechanism. It also underscores the limitations of viewing family structure from an individual-level perspective when explaining racial inequality. Local manifestations of structural racism are part of how family structure matters for inequality in poverty.},

Simultaneously, alter-globalization activists have promoted alternative water governance models through North-South red-green alliances between organized labour, environmental groups, women's groups, and indigenous groups. In this paper, I explore these distinct (albeit overlapping) responses to water privatization. I first present a generic conceptual model of market environmentalist reforms, and explore the contribution of this framework to debates over `neoliberalizing nature'. This conceptual framework is applied to the case of anti-privatization activism to elucidate the limitations of the human right to water as a conceptual counterpoint to privatization, and as an activist strategy. In contrast, I argue that alter-globalization strategies{\textemdash}centred on concepts of the commons{\textemdash}are more conceptually coherent, and also more successful as activist strategies. The paper concludes with a reiteration of the need for greater conceptual precision in our analyses of neoliberalization, for both academics and activists.},

The question is addressed by introducing a set of techniques {\textendash} partly analytic and partly numerical {\textendash} that allow consideration of forward-looking expectations in the standard core-periphery model. The techniques reveal a startling result. Forward-looking behaviour is shown analytically to never affect the `break' and `sustain' points. Simulation of global adjustment paths shows that forward-looking expectations have no qualitative effect on the model's behaviour when migration costs are high; here myopia is truly an assumption of convenience. If migration costs are lower, history-versus-expectations considerations emerge and agglomeration can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.},

  doi = {10.1191/0309132503ph419oa},
  abstract = {The paper has two purposes. The first is to provide a selective review of the history of locational analysis as it bears on economic geography. Three periods are examined: the German location school of von Th{\"u}nen, Weber and L{\"o}sch that begins in the first part of the nineteenth century and ends in the middle of the twentieth century; American spatial science that starts in the mid-1950s and is in decline by the late 1970s; and the new economic geography associated with the economist Paul Krugman, and inaugurated by his 1991 book, Geography and trade. The second is to make a methodological argument. Locational analysis is most frequently justified in terms of the purity of its logical and mathematical reasoning, permitting some commentators to trace an unbroken line of progress over its 175-year history. I argue that such a claim is based upon acceptance of a broader philosophical position, rationalism - the belief that the foundation of knowledge is reason - which takes its most perfect form in logic and mathematics. Rationalism has been criticized in various ways ever since it first emerged in the Enlightenment, however, and the same critical sensibility informs this paper. Specifically, I criticize the rationalist interpretation of locational analysis by drawing upon a recent interdisciplinary body of literature arguing for the importance of local knowledge, the idea that knowledge, even abstract theoretical knowledge of the kind found in locational analysis, is shaped not by the universal but by the peculiar historical and geographical context of its production. This antirationalist argument in favour of local knowledge is exemplified by discussion of the three periods of locational analysis that form the paper's core.},

Secondly, to illustrate the importance of situation and site, the paper focuses on two of Vancouver's inner-city locales: Yaletown, on the margins of the Downtown South, a former industrial and warehousing district now regarded as the epicentre of Vancouver's new economy; and Victory Square, the former commercial heart of the early Vancouver, for many years experiencing disinvestment and decline, but now on the cusp of a major revitalisation which threatens to displace long-established social cohorts.},

In part, {\S} 2 requires Plaintiffs to prove that voting patterns within the challenged jurisdiction are polarized by race. Because most states do not track the race of voters, social scientists developed statistical methods to make the evidentiary showing required in Gingles. These methods are decades old and are often the subject of intense scrutiny in vote dilution trials. In some cases, the size of the jurisdiction and the quality of the voter file and voting records prevent plaintiffs from meeting their burden of proof. Analyzing the presence of racially polarized voting will be one of the most important issues during and after the 2021-22 redistricting round. Within the last year, an innovative method adapted from other fields of study has been applied to the racially polarized voting analysis in vote dilution cases and has been approved by a federal district court and the Second Circuit: Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG). BISG has received little scholarly attention in legal scholarship addressing voting rights yet promises to be the most critical advancement in detecting vote dilution in decades. This Article seeks to showcase this method, equipping voting rights advocates and governments alike in their effort to secure equal voting rights nationwide. This Article argues that BISG should be used by voting rights advocates as an additional method to bolster racially polarized voting analysis conclusions when the necessary data is available and of sufficient quality. Further, BISG should be utilized by governments in jurisdictions with limited access to American Community Survey or decennial census block data to redistrict in compliance with {\S} 2.},

  abstract = {Urban scholars have described the importance of gentrification in major cities across the USA since the 1970s. While there is consensus that gentrification shaped social and physical aspects of neighbourhoods, scholars have yet to agree on how gentrified neighbourhoods should be identified. Owing to the lack of consensus, gentrification was measured in a variety of ways, which greatly influenced the neighbourhoods studied in previous research and potentially the findings of research that assessed the importance of gentrification for other neighbourhood outcomes. The current study contributes to this debate by applying and comparing two census-based strategies for identifying gentrified neighbourhoods with a qualitative neighbourhood selection strategy derived from The New York Times to New York City neighbourhoods for the span of years from 1980 to 2009. Results confirm that each of the strategies identified different neighbourhoods and that qualitative strategies for identifying gentrified neighbourhoods may overlook areas that experienced similar changes to those more widely recognised as gentrified. Given these findings, additional analyses assessed which census-based neighbourhood selection strategy better represented the neighbourhoods perceived by The New York Times, a major media outlet that shaped discourse on gentrification in the USA, as having experienced gentrification.},

Complex systems are more than the sum of their parts, and a consequence of this is that any model of their structure is necessarily incomplete and partial. Models thus represent simplifications in which salient parts and processes are simulated, and given this definition, many models will exist of any particular system. In this chapter, we explore the impact of this complexity on validating models of such systems. We begin with definitions and then identify key issues as being concerned with the characterisation of system equilibrium, system environment, and the way systems and their elements extend and scale. As our perspective on these issues changes, then so do our models with implications for their testing and validation. We argue that changes in the meaning of validity, posed by the use to which such models are to be put, are central to this debate, drawing these ideas together as conclusions about the limits posed to prediction in complex systems.

  abstract = {Recent scholarship has examined changes in the geographic distribu\- tion of poor persons in America, but it remains unclear whether highand low- poverty neighborhoods have become more, or less, spatially clustered over the past several decades. Additionally, while many have argued that growth in both high-poverty spatial clusters and high-low poverty spatial clusters could yield conditions that are conducive to increases in homicide, previous research has not considered that possi\- bility. We contribute to knowledge by examining whether there have been important shifts in the spatial clustering of poverty in America between 1980 and 2010, and if so, whether those shifts were related to changes in homicide during the period. The descriptive results of our study reveal that there were notable changes in population exposure to both high- poverty and high-low poverty spatial clusters between 1980 and 2010. Fixed-effects negative binomial regression models yield lim\- ited support for the idea that changes in spatial inequality, as measured by the clustering of high- and low-poverty neighborhoods, are asso\- ciated with changes in homicide rates. In contrast, the results indicate a significant positive association between changes in exposure to very high-poverty spatial clusters and homicide trends. The findings affirm the importance of considering the spatial dynamics of demographic conditions when explaining changes in violence across communities.},

  abstract = {What evidence supports or refutes the claim articulated from various quarters that faith-based organisations (FBOs) have been repositioned as actors for combating social problems like poverty and social exclusion in cities? This paper explores FBOs as agents of social change in contemporary cities in Europe, with a glance at the US. The argument is, first, that we need to conceptualise changing dynamics between religion, politics and post-secular society in the conviction that cities are the pre-eminent loci where these new relations are forming with intensity. While state restructuring and the urbanisation of political action are well-documented processes, far less is known about similar changes in the governance of religious institutions and their consequences for the urbanising relations between religion and the public sphere. Secondly, there are a number of empirical instances of FBOs involving faith-motivated and other people who respond to problems of poverty and social exclusion in various cities across Europe and suggest a changing public role of FBOs in social and political issues. Such repositioning, however, does not relate to the public sphere without tensions and ambiguities and the paper draws out some implications for theory and practice that guide a new international and multidisciplinary research agenda.},

  abstract = {World cities are acknowledged to be key aspects of globalization. In many accounts, these cities are depicted as rivals in a global marketplace, their economic success a result of their 'competitive advantage'. However, what has not been fully acknowledged is their connectivity, and the time and effort taken by specific 'attendants' to produce the world city network. Accordingly, this paper aims to advance understanding of world city network formation by constructing a conceptual model that focuses on four major attendants (firms, sectors, cities and states), whose co-efficiencies enact network formation through two nexuses - 'city-firm' and 'state-sector' - and two communities -'cities in countries' and 'firms within sectors'. The utility of this model is demonstrated by drawing upon interviews conducted in seventy offices of 39 advanced producer service firms in banking and law. These interviews were undertaken in three world cities (London, New York, and Singapore) in the wake of the East Asian financial crisis, an event which challenged the consistency of the world city network. Showing how attendants sought to maintain and transform the world city network at this key moment of crisis, this paper concludes that studies of city competitiveness ultimately need to focus on the co-operative work that is expended in sustaining global networks.},

  abstract = {During decennial redistricting, mapmakers are often instructed to preserve political subdivisions and prior district cores as much as possible. Political subdivisions can include counties, municipalities, wards, precincts and (precisely defined) communities of interest (COIs). And while ``district core'' may not be well defined, courts overseeing redistricting may ask for ``least-change'' maps if they want to limit their role to adopting districts similar to those most recently enacted. In addition to some ambiguity in the definition of subdivisions and district cores, how to measure the amount of splitting in a plan is rarely defined and is inconsistent across states. This leaves map drawers, redistricting litigators, and courts free to interpret these guidelines in multiple ways, some of which could be favorable to their redistricting interests. In this paper, we outline several ways to measure how much a plan splits subdivisions, and how much a plan has changed from a baseline map. We show that maps with strikingly different features could each perform well by these standards, all depending on how they're measured. This is just one of many ``gameable'' pieces of the redistricting process.},

  abstract = {Traditional exposure studies that link concentrations with population data do not always take into account the temporal and spatial variations in both concentrations and population density. In this paper we present an integrated model chain for the determination of nation-wide exposure estimates that incorporates temporally and spatially resolved information about people's location and activities (obtained from an activity-based transport model) and about ambient pollutant concentrations (obtained from a dispersion model). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that such an integrated exercise was successfully carried out in a fully operational modus for all models under consideration. The evaluation of population level exposure in The Netherlands to NO2 at different time-periods, locations, for different subpopulations (gender, socio-economic status) and during different activities (residential, work, transport, shopping) is chosen as a case-study to point out the new features of this methodology. Results demonstrate that, by neglecting people's travel behaviour, total average exposure to NO2 will be underestimated by 4\% and hourly exposure results can be underestimated by more than 30\%. A more detailed exposure analysis reveals the intra-day variations in exposure estimates and the presence of large exposure differences between different activities (traffic~{$>~$}work~{$>~$}shopping~{$>~$}home) and between subpopulations (men~{$>~$}women, low socio-economic class~{$>~$}high socio-economic class). This kind of exposure analysis, disaggregated by activities or by subpopulations, per time of day, provides useful insight and information for scientific and policy purposes. It demonstrates that policy measures, aimed at reducing the overall (average) exposure concentration of the population may impact in a different way depending on the time of day or the subgroup considered. From a scientific point of view, this new approach can be used to reduce exposure misclassification.},

Larger LHD jurisdictions may achieve an economy of scale in WIC service delivery that is not matched in smaller areas. Overall, we found that WIC service provision appears relatively consistent across study states and in the presence of increasing need, with greater responsiveness to need in urban areas. As demand for some preventive services increases LHDs in rural areas may need greater support than LHDs in large jurisdictions for meeting local demand. Unlike WIC, LHD-provided services that have less consistently maintained service-delivery guidelines may have a harder time responding to increasing need. The relative consistency of a federally-funded program such as WIC may serve as a good baseline for further study of less consistently delivered programs among LHDs. LHD service statistics can serve as useful data sources in measuring volume of service delivery relative to need.},

We address this question through a novel technique that tracks population changes by race and ethnicity for comparable geographies in both 2000 and 2010. Using the Theil index, we analyze the fifty most populous metropolitan statistical areas in 2010 for changes in multigroup segregation. We classify local areas by their net population change between 2000 and 2010 using a unique unit of analysis based on aggregating census blocks. We find strong evidence that growing parts of rapidly growing metropolitan areas of the United States are crucial to understanding regional differences in segregation that have emerged in past decades. Multigroup segregation declined the most in growing parts of growing metropolitan areas. Comparatively, growing parts of shrinking or stagnant metropolitan areas were less diverse and had smaller declines in segregation. We also find that local areas with shrinking populations had disproportionately high minority representation in 2000 before population loss took place. We conclude that the regional context of population growth or decline has important consequences for the residential mixing of racial groups.},

The research has been undertaken using social network analysis tools (egonetworks) and qualitative interviews, on a non-representative sample of 23 heterosexual singles of Milan, aged between 25 and 35 years, 12 male and 11 female. Framed within the theory of community, we formulated some questions that are addressed through the analysis: the role of friendship in single people's everyday life, which in some cases substitutes the traditional family as a source of emotional, social, material and economical support; the possibility that friendship is not always intended as a source of support, and people can name friends even if they do not provide any kind of support; the effect of the network structure on the strength of dyads, that will easily disconnect if not embedded in a cohesive network. Four different kinds of friendship networks have been found: the small cliques, the company, the core/periphery structure, and the contextualised components. In the discussion section, empirical findings are analysed focusing on different strategies of friendship, and special attention is given to the gender issue. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Methodologically, we use a case study approach to delve deeply into the interpretation and implementation of school attendance zone redesign and non-school policies, specifically land use policies and tools. We draw on neo-institutionalist theory and Ray's (2019) framework of racialized organizations to make sense of school districts, planning agencies, and their policies. We find that school district rezoning policies provide a weak regulatory framework for desegregating schools because school zoning decisions are not made in a vacuum but rather are shaped by policies and actions taken by other actors in a multi-level governance structure. School zoning policies themselves prioritized capacity over desegregation, and regulations and norms governing the public engagement processes privilege opposition to desegregation. Our study points to the importance of greater coordination across governmental levels and policy arenas, and underscores how desegregation policy is part of a political and relational process between advocates, elected leaders, families, and youth across policy sectors.},

We begin with a discussion of several different measures of income segregation; each provides insight into one aspect of the patterns. Second, we describe the trends in family income segregation from 1970 to 2009. Here we find clear evidence that income segregation has grown rapidly, particularly in the last decade and particularly among black and Hispanic families. Third, we describe the variation in income segregation among the 117 metropolitan areas with populations of at least 500,000 in 2009. We document considerable variation in income segregation among metropolitan areas - a variation systematically related to several key features of metropolitan areas, including their size, level of income inequality, age composition, and average educational levels. Fourth, we investigate the metropolitan area correlates of changes in income segregation, investigating whether changes in these characteristics over time are systematically related to changes in income segregation levels. Again, we find that segregation has grown most rapidly in metropolitan areas characterized by growing income inequality, growing proportions of children, and increasing average educational attainment levels. The longitudinal analyses also show that changes in unemployment and manufacturing jobs are inversely related to income segregation.},

However, with opportunities to opt out of the zoned public school system, the social and economic contexts of neighborhoods may affect the demographic link between neighborhoods and their public neighborhood schools. Using spatial data on school attendance zones, we estimate the associations between the racial composition of elementary schools and their local neighborhoods, and we investigate how neighborhood factors shape the loose or tight demographic coupling of these parallel social contexts. The results show that greater social distance among residents within neighborhoods, as well as the availability of educational exit options, results in neighborhood public schools that are less reflective of their surrounding communities. In addition, we show that suburban schools are more demographically similar to their neighborhood attendance zones than are urban schools.},

  abstract = {Income-segregated contexts may limit residents' exposure to income inequality, suppressing concerns about economic disparity and support for economic integration. In this article, we assess the relationship between residential income segregation and attitudes about the importance of income integration in schools to understand the link between local economic conditions and individuals' attitudes about social equity. We test this relationship by measuring residential income segregation at two geographic scales{\textemdash}meso-level institutional segregation between school districts and micro-level neighborhood segregation between census tracts. We find a negative relationship between school district income segregation in individuals' residential counties and beliefs about the importance of income integration in schools, but no relationship between more fine-grained neighborhood income segregation and these same beliefs. The results suggest that the degree to which residents problematize income-segregated school contexts is associated with the relative income homogeneity of the school districts where they live, which represent the salient political boundary for the administration of educational services. These findings contribute to broader knowledge about the varied pathways and spatial scales through which segregated environments may shape beliefs about social and economic inequality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Geographic information systems (GIS) offer powerful techniques for epidemiologists. Geocoding is an important step in the use of GIS in epidemiologic research, and the validity of epidemiologic studies using this methodology depends, in part, on the positional accuracy of the geocoding process. METHODS: We conducted a study comparing the validity of positions geocoded with a commercially available program to positions determined by Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite receivers. Addresses (N = 200) were randomly selected from a recently completed case-control study in Western New York State. We geocoded addresses using ArcView 3.2 on the GDT Dynamap/2000 U.S. Street database. In addition, we measured the longitude and latitude of these addresses with a GPS receiver. The distance between the locations obtained by these two methods was calculated for all addresses. RESULTS: The distance between the geocoded point and the GPS point was within 100 m for the majority of subject addresses (79\%), with only a small proportion (3\%) having a distance greater than 800 m. The overall median distance between GPS points and geocoded points was 38 m (90\% confidence interval [CI] = 34-46). Distances were not different for cases and controls. Urban addresses (median = 32 m; CI = 28-37) were slightly more accurate than nonurban addresses (median = 52 m; CI = 44-61). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the suitability of geocoding for epidemiologic research depends on the level of spatial resolution required to assess exposure. Although sources of error in positional accuracy for geocoded addresses exist, geocoding of addresses is, for the most part, very accurate.},

Additionally, we find that Exxon, through the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA), coordinated an international campaign to dispute climate science and weaken international climate policy, beginning in the 1980s. This represents one of the first longitudinal studies of a major fossil fuel com\- pany's responses to global warming to the present, describing historical stages of awareness, preparation, denial, and delay.},

Comparisons of local rates of unemployment and mean women's earnings are made between those LMAs in which the military plays a disproportionate role in the local labor market and those in which military presence is low. Results suggest that women who live in labor market areas with a substantial (5 percent or greater) military presence have, on average, lower annual earnings and higher rates of unemployment than their counterparts who live in nonmilitary LMAs. The argument is made that through the interaction of several socially situated conditions--including gender, family, labor markets, human capital, and place--the military emerges as a source of inequality in labor market outcomes for women working on or around military installations.},

If the mobile factor is completely agglomerated in one region, it earns an agglomeration rent which can be taxed. Closer integration first results in a `race to the top' in taxes before leading to a `race to the bottom'. We reexamine these issues in a model that produces stable equilibria with partial agglomeration in addition to the core{\textendash}periphery equilibria. A bell-shaped tax differential also arises in our model. Therefore, the `race to the top' result generalises to a framework with partial agglomeration.},

  abstract = {For reasons of analytical tractability, new economic geography (NEG) models treat geography in a very simple way: attention is either confined to a simple 2-region or to an equidistant multi-region world. As a result, the main predictions regarding the impact of e.g. diminishing trade costs are based on these simple models. When doing empirical or policy work these simplifying assumptions become problematic and it may very well be that the conclusions from the simple models do not carry over to the heterogeneous geographical setting faced by the empirical researcher or policy maker. This paper tries to fill this gap by adding more realistic geography structures to the Puga (1999) model that encompasses several benchmark NEG models. By using extensive simulations we show that many, although not all, conclusions from the simple models do carry over to our multi-region setting with more realistic geography structures. Given these results, we then simulate the impact of increased EU integration on the spatial distribution of regional economic activity for a sample of 194- NUTSII regions and find that further integration will most likely be accompanied by higher levels of agglomeration.},

Air freight flows have grown rapidly because airborne trade enables firms to reconcile time-based competition and spatially dispersed production. The importance of air freight services in this regard is particularly relevant to electronics manufacturers. Case studies of freight forwarders{\textemdash}the traditional intermediaries between the firms that send and receive goods by air and the airlines that actually move air freight from city to city{\textemdash}in Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines are used to demonstrate the manner in which firms and places attain a competitive advantage in the performance of these services and how geographic variation in air freight services, in turn, affects the operations and performance of electronics firms. Finally, the article discusses the importance of these services in mediating the ability of firms and places to move to new positions along the value chains of which they are a part as their former roles become untenable.},

Indeed TWUP might be best conceived as a "flanking support" for the neoliberal turn in urban governance in British cities; morally commendable communities are defined as those who can reattach themselves to the "mainstream" and stand on their own two feet within the terms set by neoliberal market economics. When these morally charged interventions fail to connect locally, they have the potential to stir conflict over who has the authority to judge forms of community life. Mapping and accounting for the uneven development of moral conflicts over community is therefore a pressing concern. To this end, this paper presents a comparative analysis of the different ways in which moral disputes over community have surfaced in two neighborhoods, in particular-the Gorbals in central Glasgow and Ballymun in north Dublin, neighborhoods that have become iconic of the British approach to urban renewal.},

To our knowledge, these issues have not been analysed previously at this level of aggregation.

The econometric results imply a 2{\textendash}6\% higher growth in regionally concentrated industries. The effect is more pronounced for knowledge-intensive manufacturing, network industries and industries intensively using raw material. It is also found that regional entrepreneurship and regional absorption capacity are important explanations of regional growth, whereas the impact of the skill-level and economies of scale is more mixed.},

In the trade-off between aesthetics and education, education wins, resulting in a much more conventional suburban, exurban housing/neighbourhood career for onward-moving gentrifiers. I conclude by suggesting a more diffuse, provincial form of gentrification in which the different strands of cultural capital can conflict in urban space (rather than the smooth reproduction of cultural capital assumed by the idea of a gentrification habitus). It confirms that the intergenerational reproduction of an (urban) new middle class is likely to be confined to large metropolitan areas.},

In the literature, little attention has been paid to power dynamics in socially mixed neighbourhoods and the implications this may have for understanding theory and policy. The five articles that make up this symposium address the ways in which social and ethnic groups interact in major cities in Europe and North America and, as the title suggests, this involves taking into account power relations, domination and negotiation between the different groups. There is a need to connect the experience of the deployment of power within neighbourhoods (and between them) with the discussions of power mechanisms at work in wider urban processes.},

However, some Federal agencies have been partnering successfully for many decades. Two such agencies, the Department of Commerce's U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of the Interior's U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), have had partnerships that resulted in fundamental changes to the field of geographic data processing. While these agencies had cooperated successfully on projects earlier, from 1983 to 1989, they conducted a major partnership that resulted in the creation of the USGS' 1:100,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) and the Census Bureau's Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) database. These datasets changed not only Federal geographic data processing practices but also set the course for future geographic data processing in state, local, and tribal governments, as well as in academia and private industry. Now, both agencies have embarked on ambitious programs to improve and evolve their datasets to meet more demanding Federal and other needs for the coming decades. The Census Bureau is improving its combined Master Address File (MAF) and TIGER database through an effort known as the MAF/TIGER Accuracy Improvement Project (MTAIP). Simultaneously, the USGS is undertaking the creation of The National Map, the initial foundation of which is existing datasets such as the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Although each agency's program objectives are unique to their respective missions, the products of their labors are, once again, complementary. Given their history of partnership, it was logical for the Census Bureau and the USGS to again share risks and results. Commonalities between their respective databases and missions have been identified and an effort launched to reduce redundancy in data collection and preparation, while still assuring the objectives of the resulting databases are achieved and meet the overarching objectives of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI).},

  abstract = {Answering calls for increased sensitivity to context in studies of electoral conflicts in local gay rights issues, we offer an exploratory case study of an unsuccessful electoral initiative to repeal a Tacoma, Washington, gay rights ordinance. Using a mixed-methods approach, we explore the role of elections in contemporary cultural politics, especially the ways in which race, class, and sexuality are co-constructed in part through the discourses and practices of elections. We perform a qualitative analysis of the popular rhetorics and understandings deployed during the campaign and a quantitative analysis of the election's sociodemographics. Results suggest that while there is a distinct social geography in Tacoma that was highly correlated with voting on the repeal effort, the contest was played out almost entirely at the citywide scale. It was enjoined as a debate over what kind of place Tacomans wished their city to be as it moves into the future, not as a struggle between contending place-based interests or values. The implication of these results is that the nuances of place at particular scales, including highly contingent constructions of sexuality, race and class, may now be more important than ever in these sorts of cultural conflicts. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {This study is concerned with racial/ethnic intermixing as it varies among the 49 largest U.S. MSAs in 2000 and its change over the 1990-2000 decade. Race/ethnicity is defined in terms of the major census categories of African American, American Indian, Asian, Caucasian, and Hispanic. Intermixing is calibrated by the Theil Entropy Index, which treats the five groups simultaneously and produces measures of an MSA's diversity (Diversity Score) and its level of intermixing (Entropy). The latter (Entropy) also serves as a dependent variable in regression analyses, wherein independent variables include demographic, socio-economic, and built-environment characteristics. The study departs from earlier work at the urban system level in a number of ways. First, MSAs are treated as objects of study in their own right, not simply as observational units. Second, this leads to challenging the usual practice of employing a 1/0 dummy variable to indicate the region in which an MSA is located, a practice that interferes with the emergence of other, more place-specific factors. Third, earlier studies mainly examine metropolitan areas from the perspective of two-group comparisons, rather than the multi-group comparison approach taken here. Fourth, in a major conceptual departure from earlier work, we contextualize racial/ethnic mixing and its 1990-2000 change within broader forces of economic restructuring related to the Fordist/Post-Fordist transition and broad transformational processes that invoke such concepts as inertia, sunk cost, and path dependence effects. Especially noteworthy in our findings is that MSAs that lagged in racial/ethnic intermixing in 1990 experienced the greatest change in the 1990-2000 decade, a catch-up phenomenon that we attribute to a set of widely shared norms concerning intermixing{\textemdash}termed the community, or social, norm premise.},

Five dimensions of urban sustainability attributes are examined (environmental, public health, economic utility, sprawl, and local government plans and policies) as well as a summative index across the five dimensions. The three political culture theories are creative class, social capital, and historical legacy. First, the analysis examines the relationships among the five dimensions of sustainability. Second, a correlation analysis exhibits further evidence of major effects attributable to social capital and historical legacy cultural heritage. Third, a multiple regression analysis predicts the summative sustainability index score by measures for creative class, social capital, moralistic cultural legacy, and controls for education level and percentage of low income households; both a moralistic cultural heritage and strong social capital are shown to be facilitative contexts for a US city making a commitment to sustainability, even in the presence of demographic controls. The results suggest that environmental professionals engaged in sustainability efforts must be cognizant of their cultural context and of the linkages among different sustainability domains.

  abstract = {In this paper I analyse the nature of proximity and distance as experienced through the use of sound-communication technologies. I argue that contemporary media-based analyses of communication technologies often fail to take into account the specific relational qualities attached to forms of 'sound' consumption. The meanings and uses attached to sound technologies are then conceptualised through reinterpreting three iconic historical moments of sound consumption in Western culture: Horkheimer and Adorno's account of the meeting between Odysseus and the Sirens in The Dialectic of Enlightenment, and early-20th-century accounts of the use of the phonograph and radio taken from the work of Kracauer and Taussig. One example is situated in the mythic prehistory of Western culture, the other two from its 'heroic' period of mechanical reproduction. These examples arc used to point to what an analytical framework for understanding contemporary states of aural proximity and distance might look like. The paper points to the manner in which the use of sound technologies can be understood as part of the Western project of the appropriation and control of space, place, and the 'other'. In particular I focus upon the specific relational qualities attached to sound through which subjects relate to their surroundings, others, and themselves, focusing upon the central role that aestheticisation plays as a strategy of the control of place and space. The analysis is contextualised through a contemporary analysis of that most mobile and privatised of media artefacts, the Walkman.},

We contrast this with present-oriented variables like demographics. To operationalise the signal implicit in property values, we contrast the percentile rank of a neighbourhood's average house price to that of its average income, relative to its metropolitan area. We take as our signal of gentrification the rise of a neighbourhood's house value percentile above its income percentile. We show that a gap between the house value and income percentiles predicts future income growth. We further validate our metric against existing approaches to identify gentrification, finding that it aligns meaningfully with qualitative analyses built on local insight. Compared to existing quantitative approaches, we obtain similar results but usually observe them in earlier years and with more parsimonious data. Our approach has several advantages: conceptual simplicity, communicative flexibility with graphical and map forms and availability for small geographies on an annual basis with minimal lag.},

The data reveal that candidates often diverge, but that the degree of candidate polarization is variable and may be explained by factors in the theory. Candidates with firm public reputations, those who face weak general election competition, and those who experience stiff primary competition are all more likely to deviate from the median voter's position. Perhaps more importantly, the locations that candidates adopt have clear effects on their vote shares.},

  abstract = {Majority-minority voting districts have been advanced as a remedy to the underrepresentation of minority interests in the political process. Yet, their efficacy in furthering the substantive goals of minority constituents has been questioned because they may dilute minority influence in surrounding areas and lead to an overall decrease in support for minority-sponsored legislation. Thus, there may be a trade-off between increasing the number of minority officeholders and enacting legislation that furthers the interests of the minority community. Using nonlinear estimation techniques, we simulate the districting strategies that maximize substantive minority representation, and find that such a trade-off does exist. We also find that, outside of the South, dividing minority voters equally across districts maximizes substantive representation; inside the South the optimal scheme creates concentrated districts on the order of 47\% black voting age population. In addition, minority candidates may have a substantial chance of being elected from districts with less than 50\% minority voters.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a participatory action research process that has been shaped by poststructuralist thought. We report on the stages and outcomes of a project conducted in the Latrobe Valley, Victoria, Australia, a resource region that has experienced downsizing and privatising of its major employer, the state-owned power industry. Through a participatory action research process involving community members, local Council and academic researchers the singular economic identity of the region was challenged and a more enabling representation developed. Drawing on a discourse of the diverse economy and the asset-based approach to community development the project shed light on the wide range of economic activities residents were already engaged in and the multitude of abilities and ideas they possessed. This exercise produced a new representation of the economy of the Latrobe Valley that helped to shift the vision of what was possible in the region. In the final stage of the project this alternative vision was acted on as groups turned shared ideas into projects and those who were most used to being defined as economically dependent and victims of economic circumstances increasingly came to identify as active and contributing economic subjects in the diverse economy. The paper considers the role of subjectivity, representation and micropolitics in participatory action research and concludes with a reflection on the project's strengths and weaknesses. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Papers in Regional Science {\textcopyright} 2016 RSAI The methods used to define functional regions for public statistics and policy purposes need to establish several parameter values. This is typically achieved using expert knowledge based on qualitative judgements and lengthy consultations with local stakeholders. We propose to support this process by using an optimization algorithm to calibrate any regionalization method by identifying the parameter values that produce the best regionalization for a given quantitative indicator. The approach is exemplified by using a grid search and a genetic algorithm to configure the official methods employed in the UK and Sweden for the definition of their respective official concepts of local labour markets.},

The process of globalization has shifted the debate from the national domain to the global debate, prompting the emergence of a global civil society and of ad hoc forms of global governance Accordingly, the public sphere as the space of debate on public affairs has also shifted from the national to the global and is increasingly constructed around global communication networks. Public diplomacy, as the diplomacy of the public, not of the government, intervenes in this global public sphere, laying the ground for traditional forms of diplomacy to act beyond the strict negotiation of power relationships by building on shared cultural meaning, the essence of communication.},

Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (2018) the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down as a ``severe and durable'' partisan gerrymander the congressional map drawn by Republicans in 2011 and used in elections from 2012-2016. It did so entirely on state law grounds after a three-judge federal court had rejected issuing a preliminary injunction against the plan. After Pennsylvania failed to enact a lawful remedy plan of its own (due to total disagreement as to how to proceed between the newly elected Democratic governor and the still Republican-controlled legislature), the Court then ordered into place for the 2018 election a map of its own drawn for it by a court-appointed consultant. In a split court, the Court map was endorsed only by judges with Democratic affiliations. Here we compare the 2011 and 2018 congressional maps in terms of a variety of proposed metrics for detecting partisan gerrymandering. We also examine the remedy map proposed by a group of Republican legislators and that proposed by the Democratic governor. We conclude that the 2011 map was a blatant and undisguised pro-Republican gerrymander. Moreover, the remedy map proposed by Republican legislators was a covert pro-Republican gerrymander (what we refer to as a ``stealth gerrymander''). The Democratic governor's proposed plan cannot be classified as a pro-Democratic gerrymander and indeed has, if anything, a slight pro-Republican tilt. The 2018 courtdrawn remedial map, by all measures, was not a gerrymander.},

We find that the strategies used to maintain social order contribute to redirecting the integrationist aims of the development policy toward a kind of incorporated exclusion, in which physical integration reproduces marginalization and leads more to withdrawal and alienation than to the engagement and inclusion of relocated public housing residents and other low-income residents.},

We show that, in fact, it is advantageous for the minority to arrange themselves in clusters, as it is positively correlated with representation.

First, black Americans and American Indians have much lower rates of upward mobility and higher rates of downward mobility than whites, leading to persistent disparities across generations. Conditional on parent income, the black-white income gap is driven by differences in wages and employment rates between black and white men; there are no such differences between black and white women. Hispanic Americans have rates of intergenerational mobility more similar to whites than blacks, leading the Hispanic-white income gap to shrink across generations. Second, differences in parental marital status, education, and wealth explain little of the black-white income gap conditional on parent income. Third, the black-white gap persists even among boys who grow up in the same neighborhood. Controlling for parental income, black boys have lower incomes in adulthood than white boys in 99\% of Census tracts. The few areas with small black-white gaps tend to be low-poverty neighborhoods with low levels of racial bias among whites and high rates of father presence among blacks. Black males who move to such neighborhoods earlier in childhood have significantly better outcomes. However, fewer than 5\% of black children grow up in such areas. Our findings suggest that reducing the black-white income gap will require efforts whose impacts cross neighborhood and class lines and increase upward mobility specifically for black men.},

First, we characterize the joint distribution of parent and child income at the national level. The conditional expectation of child income given parent income is linear in percentile ranks. On average, a 10 percentile increase in parent income is associated with a 3.4 percentile increase in a child's income. Second, intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas within the United States. For example, the probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4\% in Charlotte but 12.9\% in San Jose. Third, we explore the factors correlated with upward mobility. High mobility areas have (i) less residential segregation, (ii) less income inequality, (iii) better primary schools, (iv) greater social capital, and (v) greater family stability. Although our descriptive analysis does not identify the causal mechanisms that determine upward mobility, the publicly available statistics on intergenerational mobility developed here can facilitate research on such mechanisms.

In the first part, we present quasi-experimental evidence that neighborhoods a↵ect intergenerational mobility through childhood exposure e↵ects. In partic-ular, the outcomes of children whose families move to a better neighborhood {\textendash} as measured by the outcomes of children already living there {\textendash} improve linearly in proportion to the time they spend growing up in that area. We distinguish the causal e↵ects of neighborhoods from con-founding factors by comparing the outcomes of siblings within families, studying moves triggered by displacement shocks, and exploiting sharp variation in predicted place e↵ects across birth cohorts, genders, and quantiles. We also document analogous childhood exposure e↵ects for college attendance, teenage birth rates, and marriage rates. In the second part of the paper, we identify the causal e↵ect of growing up in every county in the U.S. by estimating a fixed e↵ects model identified from families who move across counties with children of di↵erent ages. We use these estimates to decompose observed intergenerational mobility into a causal and sorting com-ponent in each county. For children growing up in families at the 25th percentile of the income distribution, each year of childhood exposure to a one standard deviation (SD) better county increases income in adulthood by 0.5\%. Hence, growing up in a one SD better county from birth increases a child's income by approximately 10\%. Low-income children are most likely to succeed in counties that have less concentrated poverty, less income inequality, better schools, a larger share of two-parent families, and lower crime rates. Boys' outcomes vary more across areas than girls, and boys have especially poor outcomes in highly-segregated areas. In urban areas, better areas have higher house prices, but our analysis uncovers significant variation in neighborhood quality even conditional on prices.},

  abstract = {The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) experiment offered randomly selected families living in high- poverty housing projects housing vouchers to move to lower-poverty neighborhoods. We present new evidence on the impacts ofMTOon children's long-term outcomes using administrative data from tax returns. We find that moving to a lower-poverty neighborhood significantly improves college attendance rates and earnings for children who were young (below age 13) when their families moved. These children also live in better neighborhoods themselves as adults and are less likely to become single parents. The treatment effects are substantial: children whose families take up an experimental voucher to move to a lower-poverty area when they are less than 13 years old have an annual income that is \$3,477 (31\%) higher on average relative to a mean of \$11,270 in the control group in their mid-twenties. In contrast, the same moves have, if anything, negative long-term impacts on children who are more than 13 years old when their families move, perhaps because of the disruption effects of moving to a very different environment. The gains from moving fall with the age when children move, consistent with recent evidence that the duration of exposure to a better environment during childhood is a key determinant of an individual's long-term outcomes. The findings imply that offering vouchers to move to lower-poverty neighborhoods to families with young children who are living in high- poverty housing projects may reduce the intergenerational persistence of poverty and ultimately generate positive returns for taxpayers.},

Research in social science has provided a formal basis for the segregative outcomes resulting from the residential selection process and simulations have replicated relevant spatial outcomes under different specifications of the residential dynamics. New and increasingly detailed survey data on preferences demonstrates the embeddedness of the Schelling selection process in the social behaviors of choosing alternative residential compositions. It also demonstrates that, in the multicultural context, seemingly mild preferences for living with similar neighbors carry the potential to be strong determinants for own race selectivity and residential segregation.},

  abstract = {Households choose places from a hierarchy of options defined by social, economic and environmental contexts and these choices are conditioned by economic contexts and family status. While we know a good deal about the choice processes, we know somewhat less about the spatial outcomes of these decisions apart from the well-established finding that most residential changes involve relatively short distances. Recent research has begun to fill that gap and in this paper the research is extended by using data from the survey Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) to construct matrices of socio-spatial movement and consider the relationship of community in-flows and out-flows and the probability moving above and below the diagonal of the matrix. The research shows that there is substantial movement across the matrix of opportunities defined by an Index of Advantage and Disadvantage (Seifa). Economic resources and social status improves an individual's chance of moving up, as expected, and there is little evidence of polarisation and isolation of the lowest decile communities. It is true that there is substantial within-decile movement but there is also movement away from the diagonal. The analysis suggests that the opportunity matrix is still open in Australia.},

  abstract = {There continues to be cross-disciplinary interest in the patterns, extent, and changing contexts of segregation and spatial inequality more generally. The changes are clearly context dependent but at the same time there are broad generalizations that arise from the processes of residential sorting and selection. A major question in U.S. segregation research is how the growth of Asian and Hispanic populations is influencing patterns of segregation and diversity at the neighborhood level. In this article we use a variant of a nearest neighbor approach to map, graph, and evaluate patterns of race and ethnicity at varying scales. We show that using a multiscalar approach to segregation can provide a detailed and more complete picture of segregation. The research confirms work from other studies that segregation is decreasing between some groups and increasing between others, and the patterns, and processes can be described as dynamic diversity. In a series of maps of ethnic clusters and population homogeneity we show how metropolitan areas, represented in this case by Los Angeles, now display patterns of complex living arrangements with multiple groups inhabiting both local neighborhoods and wider community spheres.},

Specifically, we analyze the deployment of specific ecological scales as putatively `natural' governance units in rescaling processes. To undertake this analysis, the paper brings two sets of literature into dialogue: (1)\,political ecology of scale and (2)\,political economy of rescaling, drawing on theories of uneven development. Building on this literature, we develop the concept of an ecoscalar fix and explore its analytical potential through a case study of the rescaling of water governance in Alberta, Canada. We argue that although the `eco-scalar fix' is usually framed as an apolitical governance change{\textemdash}particularly through the framing of particular scales (ie,\,the watershed) as `natural'{\textemdash}it is often, in fact, a deeply political move that reconfigures power structures and prioritizes some resource uses over others in ways that can entrench, rather than resolve, the crises it was designed to address. Moreover, we suggest that, although watershed governance is often discursively depicted as an environmental strategy (eg, internalizing environmental externalities by aligning decision making with ecological boundaries), it is often articulated with{\textemdash}and undertaken to address challenges that arise through{\textemdash}processes of uneven development.},

Although recent discussions provide conflicting answers to this question, the absence of long-term, longitudinal neighborhood data curtails direct examination of the issue. Focusing on the city of Denver, we develop a new strategy for analyzing neighborhood dynamics from 1940 to the present day. Our analysis of these data reveals surprising persistence in the income rank of neighborhoods between 1940 and 2016, which appears to be driven by the enduring position of white, upper-income places at the top of the neighborhood hierarchy. When low-income neighborhoods do rise in income rank, we find that change tends to be spatially concentrated in specific areas of the city and accelerates during broader historical episodes of urban change. We conclude that neighborhood inequality in Denver has endured over long periods of time and through substantial shifts in the wider urban landscape. Key Words: gentrification, GIS, inequality, neighborhoods, spatial demography.},

We contend that residential mobility and immobility should be re-conceptualized as relational practices that link lives through time and space while connecting people to structural conditions. Re-thinking and re-assessing residential mobility by exploiting new developments in longitudinal analysis will allow geographers to understand, critique and address pressing societal challenges.},

However, many analyses are bivariate rather than multivariate and do not disentangle the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic status from that of race. Furthermore, the fringe services industry contends that market factors, such as zoning, arterials, population base, and commercial activity influence location. This study employs geographic information systems (GIS) and multiple regression to untangle the spatial relationship between minority communities and traditional and fringe banks in four small-to-moderate-sized metropolitan areas. We find that, though market factors are indeed powerful determinants of fringe bank location, there are nonetheless persistent ethnic effects in two of the four cities and these effects cannot be attributed to factors correlated with a large minority presence.},

  author = {Cover, Benjamin Plener},

  volume = {70},
  urldate = {2020-04-20},
  abstract = {Electoral districting presents a risk of partisan gerrymandering: the manipulation of electoral boundaries to favor one political party over another. For three decades, the U.S. Supreme Court has failed to settle on a legal test for partisan gerrymandering, and such claims have uniformly failed. Until recently. Plaintiffs prevailed before a three-judge federal panel in Wisconsin by leveraging a new measure called the "efficiency gap," which quantifies partisan gerrymandering in terms of two parties' relative efficiency at translating votes for their party into seats in government. The case is now before the Court, which may embrace the efficiency gap approach and thereby remake the law of electoral districting. Through a synthesis of mathematical and legal analysis, this Article examines the efficiency gap measure, focusing particularly on its underlying methodological choices and electoral assumptions as well as its relationship to competitiveness, seats-votes proportionality, and voter turnout. The efficiency gap is a useful indicative measure of partisan gerrymandering under the circumstances of cases like the one currently before the Court, in which each party earns about half the votes and a large efficiency gap persists under plausible variations in voter behavior. Relying in part on the efficiency gap measure, the Court should rule in favor of the plaintiffs. However, a mapmaker can achieve a below-threshold efficiency gap with a skewed bipartisan gerrymander that carves a state up into uncompetitive districts denying minority parties sufficient representation. For example, a party that earns only 59\% of the vote can secure a filibuster-and veto-proof 75\% supermajority of the legislature with a below-provided excellent research assistance. A special thank you to Samson J. Schatz and the entire editing team at the Stanford Law Review for their patience, diligence, and insights throughout the editing process. As always, I am particularly indebted to Aliza Plener Cover.},

  abstract = {Researchers studying discrimination and bias frequently conduct experiments that use racially distinctive names to signal race or ethnicity. The evidence that these studies provide about racial discrimination depends on the assumption that the names researchers use differ only based on perceived race and not some other factor. In this article, we assess this common assumption using data from five different studies (n = 1,004; 2,002; 1,035; 5,631; 1,858) conducted at different times across four separate survey platforms (Lucid Marketplace, Lucid Theorem, MTurk, and Prolific). We find evidence that names commonly used to signal race/ethnicity also influence perceptions about socioeconomic status and social class. Specifically, we observe that Americans tend to think that individuals with names typically used by Black and Hispanic people have lower educational attainment and income and are of a lower social class. Even when we present respondents with the educational attainment of a named individual, respondents still perceive Black people as lower social class than White people. We discuss the implications of these findings for past and future experimental work that uses names to signal race. We also articulate the importance of choosing names that best approximate the quantity that scholars want to estimate.},

Net of the influence of local neighborhood conditions and other predictors of residential mobility, high concentrations of minorities in surrounding neighborhoods reduce the likelihood that white householders will move, presumably by reducing the attractiveness of the most likely residential alternatives. This effect suppresses the influence of the racial composition of the immediate neighborhood so that controlling for extralocal conditions provides substantially greater support for the white flight thesis than has previously been observed. We also find that recent growth in the size of the extralocal minority population increases the likelihood of white out-migration and accounts for much of the influence previously attributed to racial change in the local neighborhood. Finally, high levels of minority concentration in surrounding neighborhoods exacerbate the positive effect of local minority concentration on white out-migration. These results highlight the importance of looking beyond reactions to local racial conditions to understand mobility decisions and resulting patterns of segregation.},

  abstract = {Our essay begins from the premise that residential segregation by race remains a defining feature of most metropolitan areas and continues to exert strong and multifaceted im-pacts on the life chances of segregated populations. Despite declines in average levels of segregation and the increasing prevalence of multiethnic neighborhoods (Glaeser and Vigdor 2012), overall levels of segregation between black and white Americans remain high by most measures, and are especially pronounced in cities with the largest black pop-ulations (Massey and Tannen 2015; Massey 2015). Levels of segregation between Latinos and whites, and between Asians and whites, have changed very little in recent decades (Massey 2015). The consequences of this persistent segregation are vast and well documented. The central repercussion is that members of different racial and ethnic groups are still ex-posed, on average, to fundamentally unequal neighborhood environments. A huge body of research has linked this segregation to the persistence of profound racial differences in life chances as reflected in differential exposure to neighborhood poverty (Logan 2011), crime (Peterson and Krivo 2010), and pollution (Crowder and Downey 2010; Jones et al. 2014), access to educational and employment opportunities (De la Roca et al. 2014; Frankenberg 2013; Kneebone and Holmes 2015; Logan et al. 2012), and a wide range of individual outcomes, including earnings (Thomas and Moye 2015), wealth (Shapiro et al. 2013), and health (Kershaw and Albrecht 2015; Subramanian et al. 2005; White and Borrell 2011; Yang and Matthews 2015). These consequences of segregation extend well beyond those felt by segregated minorities. The more insidious effects of segregation are on the broader social, political, and economic health of the country, as evidenced most publicly in the ongoing unrest over police violence against people of color, the roots of which can be found in the profound racial injustices borne out of segregation and differ-ential opportunity structures. Yet, while evidence for the continuing salience of segregation is strong, our explana-tions for its persistence remain relatively weak. Our collective attempts to understand the root causes of segregation have fallen into a kind of intellectual malaise, characterized by the overly simplistic and completely automatic application of a few simple theoretical arguments. These arguments are incapable of explaining why segregation remains such 18 MOVING BEYOND THE BIG THREE a defining characteristic of most of our metropolitan areas, despite liberalizing racial at-titudes, reductions in the most overt forms of discrimination, economic advancement for some minority groups, and technological advances that should loosen the ties of neigh-borhood. Our explanations, in short, have become out-dated. In order to understand why segregation persists, then, we need to move in different directions theoretically and analytically. We must critically assess our current theoretical arguments, critique the as-sumptions underlying their application, consider factors not captured in these traditional arguments, and investigate ways to collect better data on the multifaceted factors that maintain residential stratification. Virtually all of the massive body of research on the patterns and drivers of segrega-tion relies on some combination of three dominant theories (Charles 2003). The first of these Big Three theoretical arguments focuses on racial differences in human capital and argues that higher levels of education, income, and wealth improve access to the most advantaged neighborhoods (Crowder et al. 2006; South and Crowder 1997) such that racial segregation arises from racial/ethnic differences in these resources. The sec-ond argument contends that residential segregation stems from racial/ethnic differences in residential preferences, with out-group avoidance or in-group affinity leading individ-uals to choose neighborhoods dominated by their own group (Charles 2006; Clark 2008; Krysan et al. 2009). Third, the place stratification perspective (Charles 2003; Logan and Molotch 1987) suggests that whites' aversion to sharing residential space with minor-ity neighbors reinforces discriminatory practices of real estate agents, landlords, mort-gage lenders, and neighbors (Roscigno et al. 2009; Ross and Turner 2005), which creates a racially-segmented housing market that produces disparate residential outcomes. In essence, the tendency is to assume that segregation comes about because members of different groups simply prefer different kinds of neighborhoods, some groups lack the resources needed to gain access to " better " neighborhoods, or discriminatory treatment in the housing market denies people the opportunity to live where they would like. There is ample research to suggest that the dynamics implicated in each of these Big Three theoretical arguments contribute to the maintenance of racial-residential strat-ification. However, the steadfast and exclusive reliance on these arguments and their somewhat simplistic application has hampered our ability to develop a stronger under-standing of the processes through which segregation is maintained and perpetuated. The way in which the field has relied on these dominant theories creates two core problems. First, the forces implicated in these theoretical arguments are often treated as compet-ing, mutually exclusive, and virtually exhaustive explanations of segregation, so much so that weak evidence in a study for one theory is interpreted as support for another of the theories. For example, if racial differences in the neighborhood attainment patterns that shape segregation persist after controls for group differences in socioeconomic condi-tions, the typical conclusion is that the remaining differences reflect some combination of discrimination and group differences in preferences (Crowder et al. 2006; Logan et al. 1996). This tendency to view existing arguments as competing and additive, of course, undermines any ability to recognize the ways in which preferences, discrimination, and economic forces interact and complement one another in the maintenance of residen-tial segregation, and closes off the assessment of more complex, but no less important, dynamics that maintain residential segregation. A second related problem is that implicit in the three dominant theories is the assump-tion that individuals possess accurate and complete information about the community 19},

Increasingly, social scientists examine various attributes of communities, their members, and their natural surroundings that facilitate and inhibit economic development. However, few empirical analyses exist that analyze the impact of a community's network structure on different forms of economic development such as on industrial recruitment and self-development. Using data collected from six communities in Washington State, the impact of a community's interorganizational network structure on industrial recruitment and self-development is examined. Results suggest that different types of network structures are better suited for different economic development strategies. A certain level of cohesiveness among community organizations and institutions are favorable for implementing self-development projects. However for industrial recruitment, networks that are bridging facilitate more types of economic development. While bonding and bridging network structures appear to be at odds with one another, it is possible for communities to increase both forms of economic development by maintaining a certain level of cohesiveness among subcomponents and increasing the number of organizations that serve as cut-points connecting non-redundant sources of information. These findings illustrate the need for communities and local activists to consider a community's network structure when deciding on an economic development strategy. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This approach may have resulted in an underestimate of the contribution of 'place' to disease risk. In this paper we argue the case for extensive (quantitative) as well as intensive (qualitative) empirical, as well as theoretical, research on health variation that incorporates 'relational', views of space and place. Specifically, we argue that research in place and health should avoid the false dualism of context and composition by recognising that there is a mutually reinforcing and reciprocal relationship between people and place. We explore in the discussion how these theoretical perspectives are beginning to influence empirical research. We argue that these approaches to understanding how place relates to health are important in order to deliver effective, 'contextually sensitive' policy interventions.},

Although voters still technically retain their right to contact their congressional representatives in order to seek redress for their concerns, we argue that the confusion created when redistricting divides ZIP Codes confounds the constituent-representative link and leaves a substantive minority of voters in representational limbo. ZIP Codes perform a functional role by organizing groups of residents into easily accessible blocs for mail service. However, congressional districts split the ZIP Codes of over 100 million Americans. Splitting ZIP Codes across multiple congressional districts leads to constituents being confused about who their member is and greater inefficiencies for representatives to mail to their constituents. Additionally, several members of Congress actively ignore out-of-district mail. We posit that constituents from ZIP Codes split by multiple congressional districts will be less likely to recognize, contact, or ideologically identify with their representative. We conducted a population overlap analysis between ZIP Codes and congressional districts to determine the impact of splitting ZIP Codes on a battery of items on the Cooperative Congressional Election Survey (CCES) from 2008-2016. Our analysis provides evidence that splitting ZIP Codes across multiple congressional districts impairs the constituent-representative link. Finally, we demonstrate the preservation of ZIP Codes in redistricting is feasible and produces a substantive reduction in partisan bias.},

Results show that laws and regulations dominate the spatial outcomes of governance processes between city and port, and that these tend to frustrate experimental efforts towards truly sustainable results. In addition, development orientations that foresee an on-going port migration process away from the urban core are still common among urban planning and policy makers, which impedes on the joint governance processes needed for building renewed, sustainable port{\textendash}city relations and spatial projects.

This paper uses a data set of more than 4,000,000 commuter flows as the basis for an empirical approach to the identification of such megaregions. We compare a method which uses a visual heuristic for understanding areal aggregation to a method which uses a computational partitioning algorithm, and we reflect upon the strengths and limitations of both. We discuss how choices about input parameters and scale of analysis can lead to different results, and stress the importance of comparing computational results with ``common sense'' interpretations of geographic coherence. The results provide a new perspective on the functional economic geography of the United States from a megaregion perspective, and shed light on the old geographic problem of the division of space into areal units.},

By taking into account the spatially differentiated social embedding of individuals, we are able to highlight the impact of local institutions on electoral behavior and restore the temporal dimension that has shaped the political specificities of places. In the case of Belgium, we show that social embedding (which took the very accomplished form of pillars) affects voting behavior through two different channels: a direct effect, coming from the family transmission of pillar values, and a contextual effect captured by a measure of the local embeddedness of the pillar. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, both are prone to treating coercion as the antithesis of power, leading them to downplay the coercive modalities of neoliberalism. This paper applies the Gramscian theory of the integral state to correct the bias towards non-coercive power. The integral state rejects the power-violence dualism, depicting coercive and non-coercive modalities of power and counter-power as inhering in capitalist political economy. The paper argues that studying neoliberalism from the perspective of the integral state contributes to explaining the intractability of coercion in the governance system and in particular the coercive power of the local state. It concludes by reflecting on the implications of this perspective for political action, arguing for a resolutely critical and conflictual stance.},

To detractors, L.A. is a sunlit mortuary where ``you can rot without feeling it.'' To Mike Davis, the author of this fiercely elegant and wide-ranging work of social history, Los Angeles is both utopia and dystopia, a place where the last Joshua trees are being plowed under to make room for model communities in the desert, where the rich have hired their own police to fend off street gangs, as well as armed Beirut militias.  In City of Quartz, Davis reconstructs L.A.'s shadow history and dissects its ethereal economy. He tells us who has the power and how they hold on to it. He gives us a city of Dickensian extremes, Pynchonesque conspiracies, and a desperation straight out of Nathaniel West - a city in which we may glimpse our own future mirrored with terrifying clarity.},

  abstract = {Redistricting is the problem of partitioning a set of geographic units into a fixed number of subsets called districts, subject to a list of rules and priorities. These districts are used for elections, making their delineation highly consequential. It has been hard for quantitative researchers to orient to an application domain in which rule vagueness can be a feature rather than a bug{\textemdash}but law and policy often prefer a reasonable range of values to a paradigm of optimization. In recent years, the use of randomized methods to sample from the vast space of districting plans has been gaining traction in U.S. courts of law for identifying partisan gerrymanders, and it is now emerging as a promising assessment tool for legislatures and independent commissions, even before districts are enacted. In this article, we set up redistricting as a graph partition problem and introduce a new family of Markov chains called recombination (or ReCom). We focus on the use of spanning trees for recombination, an idea introduced by our research group in 2018 and now in wide use in the redistricting field. ReCom is a large-step random walk on the space of graph partitions, in contrast with commonly used Flip walks, which change the assignment label of one or a few nodes at a time. Important points of comparison concern the speed of convergence to stationarity, the form of the target distribution, and the characteristics of samples that can be obtained in practical time. We use real-world data to demonstrate advantages of spanning tree ReCom and its relative weighting of plans, and we give a broader exposition of both the challenges of this approach and the analytical tools that it enables. We close with a short case study of race and redistricting in the Virginia House of Delegates.},

Participants in the workshop were asked to offer their views on the topic and our suggestions for further research. This contribution explores some aspects of the relationship and relevance of geography to the question of race in North America. It touches on three "places" that constitute the discipline: the place of research, the place of teaching, and the workplace. With respect to research, it suggests some promising lines of inquiry. Among these are studies of the relationship of scale to the politics of identity and studies of "passing" in connection with studies of geographies of experience and geographies of power.

  abstract = {Women's labor market participation in Chile ranks among the lowest in Latin America. In a country where over 90 percent of the population lives in segregated cities, where employment opportunities cluster in affluent neighborhoods, residential sorting has surprisingly been neglected as an explanatory factor. This article addresses this omission by calculating the effects of residential segregation on labor market participation among less-educated caregivers. Using an OLS fixed effects model, the study finds that segregation entails adverse spatial mismatch effects on labor market participation. No other sub-population is affected in this manner. Hence, residential segregation contributes to the consolidation of three types of inequalities. First, it reproduces gendered inequalities within less-educated households. Second, in the context of increasing labor market participation among more-educated women, residential segregation further increases inequalities between low-income and affluent households. Finally, it deepens geographical inequalities between marginalized and non-marginalized households.HIGHLIGHTS Residential segregation has excluded less-educated caregiving women from paid work.Less-educated communities reside in regions with low job density.A spatial mismatch is a gendered phenomenon insofar as mobility is gendered.Segregation does not affect men's or more-educated women's labor force participation.Segregation aggravates economic, geographic, and gender inequalities.},

Using five decades of Census data from 1970 to 2010, a clustering procedure is used to establish five classes of neighborhoods: Suburban, Stability, Blue Collar, Struggling, and New Starts. The transitions and sequences of neighborhoods through these groups are compared, revealing marked differences in the dynamics of neighborhoods according by city. Findings show that while Struggling neighborhoods, characterized largely by high poverty and unemployment levels, were very unlikely to transition out of this group over the course of 50 years in the cities of Buffalo, Charlotte, and Chicago, nearly half Portland's struggling neighborhoods transitioned to a neighborhood of higher socioeconomic status during that time period. The types of neighborhoods that exhibited signs of gentrification also varied according to city. The variability of neighborhood trajectories was greatest for the rapidly growing cities of Charlotte and Portland while neighborhoods in Buffalo and Chicago tended to follow a more predicable downgrading process.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE Uncertainty is not always well captured, understood, or modeled properly, and can bias the robustness of complex relationships, such as the association between the environment and public health through exposure, estimates of geographic accessibility and cluster detection, to name a few. METHODS We review current challenges and future opportunities as geospatial data and analyses are applied to the field of public health. We are particularly interested in the sources of uncertainty in geospatial data and how this uncertainty may propagate in spatial analysis. RESULTS We present opportunities to reduce the magnitude and impact of uncertainty. Specifically, we focus on (1) the use of multiple reference data sources to reduce geocoding errors, (2) the validity of online geocoders and how confidentiality (e.g. HIPAA) may be breached, (3) use of multiple reference data sources to reduce geocoding errors, (4) the impact of geoimputation techniques on travel estimates, (5) residential mobility and how it affects accessibility metrics and clustering, and (6) modeling errors in the American Community Survey. Our paper discusses how to communicate spatial and spatiotemporal uncertainty, and high performance computing to conduct large amounts of simulations to ultimately increase statistical robustness for studies in public health. CONCLUSIONS Our paper contributes to recent efforts to fill in knowledge gaps at the intersection of spatial uncertainty and public health.},

Individuals and families acquire wealth and property via three routes: they accumulate them through their earnings or other work, what they have accumulated appreciates over time, or they inherit wealth or property from their families. Many benefit from all three ofthese routes to the ownership ofproperty and wealth. For some, the routes are interconnected, as when parents, prior to their death, transfer assets to enable their children to attend school, start a business, or purchase a home. In theory (and in law), these routes to the acquisition ofwealth and property are available to all. They are not structured by race or ethnicity. The argument in this paper, however, is that in reality, the routes to the ownership ofwealth and property are severely constrained by race/ethnicity working through residential segregation. As a result, residential segregation helped create and continues to perpetuate},

Focusing on low- income urban mothers, a population at high risk of eviction, this study is among the first to examine rigorously the consequences of involuntary displacement from housing. Applying two methods of propensity score analyses to data from a national survey, we find that eviction has negative effects on mothers in multiple domains. Com- pared to matched mothers who were not evicted, mothers who were evicted in the previous year experienced more material hardship, were more likely to suffer from depression, reported worse health for themselves and their children, and reported more parenting stress. Some evidence suggests that at least two years after their eviction, mothers still experienced significantly higher rates of material hardship and depression than peers. Poor},

Building on and extending prior research, we devote this Research Brief to documenting from multiple new angles a highly concerning and apparently systemic problem with the IRS migration data since the IRS took over responsibilities for preparing these data from the U.S. Census Bureau in 2011. As we then discuss, despite the fact that the IRS provides documentation detailing changes that it made to how it prepares these data relative to how the U.S. Census Bureau prepared them, it is not clear why or how these changes would result in the problem detailed in our analysis. Given that this problem appears to be an internal one within the IRS, we conclude by suggesting that the post 2011{\textendash}2012 IRS migration data not be used until this problem is resolved, and we encourage the IRS to do so quickly, transparently, and collaboratively.},

We then employ demographic standardization and decomposition to determine if these losses primarily reflect changes in out-migration or the economic resources that migrants take with them. Finally, we consider the implications of these losses for changing spatial inequality in the United States. While disaster-affected areas and their populations differ in their experiences of and responses to extreme weather disasters, we generally find that, relative to the year before an extreme weather disaster, economic losses via migration from disaster-affected areas increase the year of and after the disaster, these changes primarily reflect changes in out-migration (vs. the economic resources that migrants take with them), and these losses briefly disrupt the status quo by temporarily reducing spatial inequality.},

The decrease in exposure due to the fuel price increase using residential information only was limited to areas near highways and urban centres. Integrating population movement, exposures to EC were higher and the decrease in exposure was no longer limited to areas near traffic hotspots. For inhabitants of urban areas, the exposure integrating time-activity patterns was more similar to the residential exposure, as they spent more time in their own neighbourhood. For people living further away from traffic hotspots, the estimated impact of the policy was higher than expected for residential exposure. These people profited both from the higher decrease in concentrations at their work/shop/leisure destinations in more urban areas and, as they have to travel longer, also had a larger gain from the high decrease in concentrations during transport. Therefore, the impact of changing concentrations is underestimated when using residential exposure only. These results show the importance of taking into activity-travel patterns when planning future actions.},

Although considerable advances have been made in assessing human exposure outdoors, the assessments often do not consider the impact of individual travel behavior on such exposures. Population-based exposures to NO2 and O3 using only home addresses were compared with models that integrate all time-activity patterns{\textemdash}including time in commute{\textemdash}for Flanders and Brussels. The exposure estimates were used to estimate the air pollution impact on years of life lost due to respiratory mortality. Health impact of NO2 using an exposure that integrates time-activity information was on average 1.2\% higher than when assuming that people are always at their home address. For ozone the overall estimated health impact was 0.8\% lower. Local differences could be much larger, with estimates that differ up to 12\% from the exposure using residential addresses only. Depending on age and gender, deviations from the population average were seen. Our results showed modest differences on a regional level. At the local level, however, time-activity patterns indicated larger differences in exposure and health impact estimates, mainly for people living in more rural areas. These results suggest that for local analyses the dynamic approach can contribute to an improved assessment of the health impact of various types of pollution and to the understanding of exposure differences between population groups.},

  abstract = {Population and demographic data at high spatial resolution is a valuable resource for supporting planning and management decisions as well as an important input to socio-economic academic studies. Dasymetric modeling has been a standard technique to disaggregate census-aggregated units into raster-based data of higher spatial resolution. Although utility of dasymetric mapping has been demonstrated on local and regional scales, few high resolution large-scale models exist due to their high computational cost. In particular, no publicly available high resolution dasymetric model of population distribution over the entire United States is presently available. In this paper we introduce a 3{${''}$} ({$\sim$}90~m) resolution dasymetric model of demographics over the entire conterminous United States. The major innovation is to disaggregate already existing 30{${''}$} ({$\sim$}1~km) and 7.5{${''}$} ({$\sim$}250~m) SEDAC (Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center) Census 2000 grids instead of the original census block-level data. National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) 2001 is used as ancillary information. This allows for rapid development of a U.S.-wide model for distribution of population and sixteen other demographic variables. The new model is demonstrated to markedly improve spatial accuracy of SEDAC model. To underscore importance of high spatial resolution demographic information other than total population count we demonstrate how maps of several population characteristics can be fused into a ``product'' map that illustrates complex social issues. Specifically, we introduce a ``diversity'' categorical map that informs (at nominal 3{${''}$} resolution) about spatial distribution of racial diversity, dominant race, and population density simultaneously. Diversity map is compared to a similar map based on census tracts. High resolution raster map allows study of race-diversity phenomenon on smaller scale, and, outside of major metropolitan areas, revels existence of patterns that cannot be deduced from a tract-based map. The new high resolution population and diversity maps can be explored online using our GeoWeb application DataEye available at http://sil.uc.edu/. Both datasets can be also downloaded from the same website.},

Using a grid that approximates population density over the entire country seems like the most practical approach to exploring and distributing detailed population data but instead data based on census aggregation units is still the most widely used method. In this paper we describe the construction of 30m resolution grid representing the distribution of population in 2010 over the entire conterminous United States. The grid is computed using 2010 U.S. Census block level population counts disaggregated by a dasymetric model that uses land cover (2011 NLCD) and land use (2010 NLUD) as ancillary data. Detailed descriptions of the ancillary data and dasymetric model are given. Methods of computing the grid are presented followed by an extensive assessment of model accuracy. Overall the expected value for relative error of the model is 44\% which is at the lower limit of errors reported for other continental-sized, high resolution population grids. We also offer a more specific error estimate for areas with specified value of population density. Using two example areas, one highly urbanized and another rural, we demonstrate the advantages of using the gridded population data over the census block-based data. Our 30m population grid is available for online exploration and for download from the custom-made GeoWeb application SocScape at  http://sil.uc.edu .},

Results indicated that segregation has a consistent, detrimental effect on the health of U.S.-born Hispanics, comparable to findings for blacks and black-white segregation. In contrast, segregation was salutary (though not always significant) for foreign-born Hispanics. We also found that neighborhood poverty mediates part, but not all, of the associations between segregation and poor health. Our finding of divergent associations between health and segregation by nativity point to the wide range of experiences within the diverse Hispanic population and suggests that socioeconomic status and structural factors, such as residential segregation, come into play in determining Hispanic health for the U.S.-born in a way that does not occur among the foreign-born.},

However, their remedy does not fully embrace a conclusion that much of the rest of the world has reached--that economic development policy is about helping "regions" compete in the global economic race. The secret to overhauling federal economic development policy, therefore, probably lies in positioning federal policy to supply the ingredients most essential to competitive regions. Four ingredients appear to be especially important going forward: strategy, governance, innovation, and entrepreneurship.},

For the last three Census cycles, MA has held 9-10 seats in the House of Representatives, which means that a district can be won with as little as 6 percent of the statewide vote. Putting these two facts together, one may be surprised to learn that a Massachusetts Republican has not won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives since 1994. We argue that the underperformance of Republicans in Massachusetts is not attributable to gerrymandering, nor to the failure of Republicans to field House candidates, but is a structural mathematical feature of the distribution of votes. For several of the elections studied here, there are more ways of building a valid districting plan than there are particles in the galaxy, and every one of them will produce a 9-0 Democratic delegation.},

We are then able to visualize and analyze large ensembles of computer-generated districting plans of the type commonly used in modern redistricting research (and court challenges). We set out three applications: zoning a state at each scale of districting, comparing elections, and seeking signals of gerrymandering. Our case studies focus on redistricting in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, two states whose legal challenges to enacted plans have raised considerable public interest in the last few years.},

The housing crisis that led up to the Great Recession was a moment in which the underlying vulnerabilities in our markets and institutions were laid bare. The crisis also occurred in the context of the "great risk shift" in American society--where individuals are increasingly responsible for managing the ordinary risks of life in a modern economy. The multiple sources of precarity in the housing market highlight the complex nature of insecurity that many Americans face. We look at metropolitan variability in foreclosures to identify conditions that contributed to the housing crisis. We build on prior research by showing different sources of vulnerability to the housing crisis in metropolitan areas--including labor market insecurity and housing market insecurity--and find that some of the metropolitan areas that fared the worst faced problems in both markets before the crisis.},

Reformers see IRCs, which have binding authority and political independence, as a solution to the practice of gerrymandering and have proposed using them throughout the United States. With less incentive to protect incumbents, do IRCs adhere more closely to traditional redistricting principles, such as drawing compact districts, maintaining continuity, and respecting political subdivisions? We examine a large sample of congressional and state legislative districts and find that, relative to legislatures, IRCs tend to draw more compact districts, split fewer political subdivisions, and may also do a better job of preserving the population cores of prior districts.},

  abstract = {An important topic in the study of segregation are comparisons across space and time. This article extends current approaches in segregation measurement by presenting a five-term decomposition procedure that can be used to understand more clearly why segregation has changed or differs between two comparison points. Two of the five terms account for differences in segregation that are due to the differing marginal distributions (e.g., the gender and occupational distributions), while one term accounts for differences in segregation due the different structure of segregation (what might be termed ``pure'' segregation). The decomposition thus presents a solution to the problem of margin dependency, frequently discussed in the segregation literature. Finally, two terms account for the appearance or disappearance of units when analyzing change over time. The method can be further extended to attribute structural changes to individual units, which makes it possible, for instance, to quantify the effect of each occupation on changing gender* segregation. The practical advantages of the decomposition are illustrated by two examples: a study of changing occupational gender segregation in the United States and a study of changing residential segregation in Brooklyn, New York.},

Census data show that these effects are nontrivial in relation to the magnitude of decadal changes in residential segregation. An agent-based model illustrates the potential long-run impacts of rising numbers of mixed-race households on measures of neighborhood-scale segregation. It reveals that high rates of mixed-race household formation will reduce residential segregation considerably. This occurs even when preferences for own-group neighbors are high enough to maintain racial separation in residential space in a Schelling-type model. We uncover a disturbing trend, however; levels of neighborhood-scale segregation of single-race households can remain persistently high even while a growing number of mixed-race households drives down the overall rate of residential segregation. Thus, the article's main conclusion is that parsing neighborhood segregation levels by household type-single versus mixed race-is essential to interpret correctly trends in the spatial separation of racial groups, especially when the fraction of households that are mixed race is dynamic. More broadly, the article illustrates the importance of household-scale processes for urban outcomes and joins debates in geography about interscalar relationships. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

We discuss the measurement of coagglomeration and use data from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Research Database from 1972 to 1997 to compute pairwise coagglomeration measurements for U.S. manufacturing industries. Industry attributes are used to construct measures of the relevance of each of Marshall's three theories of industry agglomeration to each industry pair: (1) agglomeration saves transport costs by proximity to input suppliers or final consumers, (2) agglomeration allows for labor market pooling, and (3) agglomeration facilitates intellectual spillovers. We assess the importance of the theories via regressions of coagglomeration indices on these measures. Data on characteristics of corresponding industries in the United Kingdom are used as instruments. We find evidence to support each mechanism. Our results suggest that input-output dependencies are the most important factor, followed by labor pooling.},

However, although the data and approaches owe much to the early contributions of demographers and population scientists, this debt is largely unrecognized. Likewise, challenges posed in the early literature remain largely unanswered. I argue that just as demographers and population scientists were pioneers in the study of neighborhoods and health, they are uniquely poised to lead the field again. Putting people into place means explaining behavior and outcomes in relation to a potentially changing local context. A more dynamic conceptualization is needed that fully incorporates human agency, integrates multiple dimensions of local social and spatial context, develops the necessary longitudinal data, and implements appropriate tools. Diverse approaches with complementary strengths will help surmount the many analytic challenges to studying the dynamics of neighborhoods and health, including agent-based microsimulation models.},

In the modelling process, we take advantage of the perspectives of both disciplines: demography being more focused on matching statistical models to empirical data, and social simulation on explanations of social mechanisms underlying the observed phenomena. This work is based on earlier attempts to introduce agent-based modelling to demography, but extends them into a multi-level and multi-state framework. We illustrate our approach with a proof-of-concept model of partnership formation and changing health status over the life course. In addition to the agent-based component, the model includes empirical elements based on demographic data for the United Kingdom. As such, the model allows analysis of the demographic dynamics at a variety of levels, from the individual, through the household, to the whole population. We bolster this analysis further by using statistical emulation techniques, which allow for in-depth investigation of the interaction of model parameters and of the resulting output uncertainty. We argue that the approach although not fully predictive per se has four important advantages. first, the model is capable of studying the linked lives of simulated individuals in a variety of scenarios. second, the simulations can be readily embedded in the relevant social or physical spaces. third, the approach allows for overcoming some data-related limitations, augmenting the available statistical information with assumptions on behavioural rules. fourth, statistical emulators enable exploration of the parameter space of the underlying agent-based models.},

We employed classic shape-based compactness measures, moment-of-inertia-based measures, and measures of partisan bias to assess the districting plans from multiple angles, including irregularity of district boundaries, spatial dispersion, population-weighted shape dispersion, and partisan symmetry. This new and combined use of spatial measures evidenced remarkable increases on the average compactness scores for California's Congress, suggesting general alleviation of the bipartisan gerrymandering in the previous plan. On the contrary, the partisan gerrymandering in North Carolina intensified in the current map, indicated by the substantial decline in the compactness scores for a majority of the districts. Analysis of partisan bias in the districting plans suggested a very slight bias toward Democrats in California in both districting plans. In North Carolina, the partisan advantage shifted from Democrats to Republicans during redistricting. Comparative analysis between the two families of spatial measures revealed the superiority of the moment of inertia family to the classic shape-based indexes for measuring compactness of congressional districts.},

  abstract = {This study investigates immigrant suburbanisation trends over the past decade in the metropolitan USA, focusing on how suburbanisation affects the residential segregation of foreign-born populations. Using 2000-2012 data from the decennial census and American Community Survey, it tracks the suburban settlement patterns of 17 country-of-origin groups. It uses a methodological approach that decomposes metropolitan segregation into within and between city/suburb components. The findings indicate that most immigrant groups rapidly suburbanised during the 2000s, though there remain large differences in suburbanisation rates among country-of-origin groups. Immigrant suburbanites tend to be less segregated from US-born whites than are their coethnic counterparts in large cities. Suburbanisation continues to blur the city/suburb divide, which now accounts for a small share of the segregation experienced by most groups. At the metro level, suburbanisation is associated with lower levels of immigrant segregation even after controlling for relevant metropolitan characteristics. These findings are consistent with spatial assimilation, though trends over time suggest a more complicated picture. While immigrants are gaining access to the suburbs, most groups experienced increasing segregation at the same time they were rapidly suburbanising. This is due to increasing segregation within the suburbs, which often offset segregation declines occurring within large cities. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the underlying and often countervailing city/suburb contributions to metropolitan segregation.}

The paper reports on two aspects of the estimation problem: 1) variance estimation for the CPS sample estimates, and 2) features of some candidate small area models that might be used to produce the required estimates at the state and county level. The two problems are interrelated: many small area models employ estimated variances for the survey estimates both in the estimation of the small area models and in their evaluation.

In this study, we combine mobile locations, weather, and COVID-19 data in a two-way fixed effects mediation model to estimate the impact of weather and policy interventions on the COVID-19 infection rate in the US before the availability of vaccines, disentangling their direct impact from the part of the effect that is mediated by the endogenous response of social activity. We show that, while temperature reduces viral infectiousness, it also increases the amount of time individuals spend out of home, which instead favours the spread of the virus. This second channel substantially attenuates the beneficial effect of temperature in curbing the spread of the virus, offsetting one-third of the potential seasonal fluctuations in the reproduction rate. The mediation role of social activity is particularly pronounced when viral incidence is low, and completely offsets the beneficial effect of temperature. Despite being significant predictors of social activity, wind speed and precipitation do not induce sufficient variation to affect infections. Our estimates also suggest that school closures and lockdowns are effective in reducing infections. We employ our estimates to quantify the seasonal variation in the reproduction rate stemming from weather seasonality in the US.},

We also find that of 15 geographic clusters of the motor vehicles value chain in the U.S., 14 consist partly of rural and/or mixed rural counties.

In a comprehensive study sponsored by the Appalachian Regional Commission and released in 2002, the authors identified technology-based clusters within and on the border of the Appalachian region. The Appalachian technology clusters constituted subregional concentrations of related industrial, research and development, and university-based strengths as of the middle to late 1990s. In this article, the authors investigate how the industries in the identified clusters fared over the subsequent several years in terms of employment and new business formation. They find evidence that clustering is associated with new business formation for selected technology industries but not with employment growth.},

Some blame a rollback of desegregation policies designed to distribute students more evenly among schools; others blame the changing racial composition of the student population. This study clarifies the link between distributive processes of segregation, population change, and school racial composition by framing school segregation as a mode of social closure. I use a novel decomposition approach to determine the relative contributions of distributive processes and compositional change in the apparent resegregation of schools from 1993 to 2010. For the most part, compositional changes are to blame for the declining presence of whites in minorities' schools. During this period, whites and minorities actually became more evenly distributed across schools, helping increase minority students' exposure to whites. Further decompositions reveal the continued success of district-level desegregation efforts, but the greatest barrier to progress appears to be the uneven distribution of students between school districts in the same area. These findings call for new research and new policies to address contemporary school segregation.},

A number of political scientists have used simulation methods to sample redistricting plans under various constraints to assess their impact on partisanship and other aspects of representation. However, while many optimization algorithms have been proposed, surprisingly few simulation methods exist in the published scholarship. Furthermore, the standard algorithm has no theoretical justification, scales poorly, and is unable to incorporate fundamental constraints required by redistricting processes in the real world. To fill this gap, we formulate redistricting as a graph-cut problem and for the first time in the literature propose a new automated redistricting simulator based on Markov chain Monte Carlo. The proposed algorithm can incorporate contiguity and equal population constraints at the same time. We apply simulated and parallel tempering to improve the mixing of the resulting Markov chain. Through a small-scale validation study, we show that the proposed algorithm can approximate a target distribution more accurately than the standard algorithm. We also apply the proposed methodology to data from Pennsylvania to demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm to real-world redistricting problems. The open-source software package is available so that researchers and practitioners can implement the proposed methodology. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Our method employs recent developments in the estimation and analysis of models with high-dimensional fixed effects. Using wage regressions with controls for multiple sources of observed and unobserved heterogeneity, we find little evidence that the quality of matching increases with firm clustering within the same industry. This result supports Freedman (2008) analysis of the software industry in one U.S. state. Since our final regressions still uncover evidence for a large wage premium from industrial clustering, the results suggest that agglomeration advantages may stem from sources beyond labor matching. The wage premium also improves with urbanization economies, in line with previous work.},

This paper examines the relationship between neighbourhood ethnic group population change and belonging. The paper measures population change as immigration, gross internal migration and with a categorisation of ethnic group population dynamics that combines migration and natural change. Pooled 2005 and 2007 Citizenship Survey data are analysed using multilevel logistic regression models. The paper does not find evidence for relationships between immigration or local population turnover and levels of neighbourhood belonging; nor is there evidence that ethnically differentiated population change matters. However, belonging does vary by individual's ethnicity; and strong belonging is associated with high co-ethnic density for minorities. In addition, the overall population change of an area may be significant: highest levels of belonging were found in areas of White and Minority population growth driven by migration.},

Using census data for 1980-2010, we find that the neighborhoods where whites and minorities reside have become more alike in terms of neighborhood poverty and median income, largely because whites now live in poorer neighborhoods and because African Americans live in less-poor neighborhoods. The narrowing of black-white neighborhood inequality since 1980 has been sizable, far exceeding the narrowing of Hispanic-white neighborhood inequality; nonetheless, despite blacks' relative gains, the disparity in black-white neighborhood economic conditions remains very large. Asian Americans, on the other hand, now reside in neighborhoods that are economically similar to the neighborhoods where whites reside. Regression analyses reveal that racial neighborhood inequality declined the most in U.S. metropolitan areas where racial residential segregation declined the most.},

Empirical studies of how violence interacts with economic and other factors shaping mobility offer lessons for both fields. Adapting existing theories that may not appear immediately applicable, such as household economy approaches, helps explain refugees' decision-making processes. At a macro level, world systems theory sheds light on the inter- active policies around refugees across states of origin, mass hosting, asylum, transit, and resettlement. Finally, focusing on the integration of refugees in the Global South reveals a pattern that poses major challenges to theories of assimilation and citizenship developed in settler states of the Global North.},

This pattern and its implications for immigrant incorporation have received a great deal of attention, but the vast majority of research has focused on Hispanics. This article examines the relationship between settlement patterns and socioeconomic attainment (income, occupational status, and homeownership) among Asians. Drawing on individual- and metro-level information from the 2009 to 2011 American Community Survey, results suggest that Asians in new destinations face an important tradeoff between income and homeownership, and that differences across contexts are largely attributable to metropolitan labor and housing market conditions, rather than the ethnic context per se. However, there are important differences in outcomes among Asians by national origin and sex, and a comparison with whites suggests that inequality differs across new and more established Asian settlement areas.}

The aim of the exercise is the division of a given territory into functional regions based on travel-to-work flows. Such regions are defined so that a high degree of inter-regional separation and of intra-regional integration in both cases in terms of commuting flows is guaranteed. Additional requirements include the absence of overlap between delineated regions and the exhaustive coverage of the whole territory. The procedure is based on the maximization of a fitness function that measures aggregate intra-region interaction under constraints of inter-region separation and minimum size. In the experimentation stage, two variations of the fitness function are used, and the process is also applied as a final stage for the optimization of the results from one of the most successful existing methods, which are used by the British authorities for the delineation of travel-to-work areas (TTWAs). The empirical exercise is conducted using real data for a sufficiently large territory that is considered to be representative given the density and variety of travel-to-work patterns that it embraces. The paper includes the quantitative comparison with alternative traditional methods, the assessment of the performance of the set of operators which has been specifically designed to handle the regionalization problem and the evaluation of the convergence process. The robustness of the solutions, something crucial in a research and policy-making context, is also discussed in the paper.},

However, the high uncertainty associated with some of the ACS's most frequently used estimates can jeopardize the accuracy of inferences based on these data. While there is high level understanding in the research community that problems exist in the data, the sources and implications of these problems have been largely overlooked. Using 2006\{2010 ACS median household income at the census tract scale as the test case (where a third of small-area estimates have higher than recommend errors), we explore the patterns in the uncertainty of ACS data. We consider various potential sources of uncertainty in the data, ranging from response level to geographic location to characteristics of the place. We nd that there exist systematic patterns in the uncertainty in both the spatial and attribute dimensions. Using a regression framework, we identify the factors that are most frequently correlated with the error at national, regional and metropolitan area scales, and nd these correlates are not consistent across the various locations tested. The implication is that data quality varies in dierent places, making cross-sectional analysis both within and across regions less reliable. We also present general advice for data users and potential solutions to the challenges identied.\vphantom\}},

  abstract = {Background: The growth of geolocated data has opened the door to a wealth of new research opportunities in the health fields. One avenue of particular interest is the relationship between the spaces where people spend time and their health outcomes. This research model typically intersects individual data collected on a specific cohort with publicly available socioeconomic or environmental aggregate data. In spatial terms: individuals are represented as points on map at a particular time, and context is represented as polygons containing aggregated or modeled data from sampled observations. Uncertainty abounds in these kinds of complex representations. Methods: We present four sensitivity analysis approaches that interrogate the stability of spatial and temporal relationships between point and polygon data. Positional accuracy assesses the significance of assigning the point to the correct polygon. Neighborhood size investigates how the size of the context assumed to be relevant impacts observed results. Life course considers the impact of variation in contextual effects over time. Time of day recognizes that most people occupy different spaces throughout the day, and that exposure is not simply a function residential location. We use eight years of point data from a longitudinal study of children living in rural Pennsylvania and North Carolina and eight years of air pollution and population data presented at 0.5 mile (0.805 km) grid cells. We first identify the challenges faced for research attempting to match individual outcomes to contextual effects, then present methods for estimating the effect this uncertainty could introduce into an analysis and finally contextualize these measures as part of a larger framework on uncertainty analysis. Results: Spatial and temporal uncertainty is highly variable across the children within our cohort and the population in general. For our test datasets, we find greater uncertainty over the life course than in positional accuracy and neighborhood size. Time of day uncertainty is relatively low for these children. Conclusions: Spatial and temporal uncertainty should be considered for each individual in a study since the magnitude can vary considerably across observations. The underlying assumptions driving the source data play an important role in the level of measured uncertainty.},

ALthough there were no extensive areas of blight, decay, or housing abandonment, we found high spatial separation of poor visible minorities in the selected cities. The index of dissimilarity indicates high segregation of poor blacks and moderate separation of poor Asians from the nonpoor population. We tested the effects of three major structural factors--racial and ethnic segregation, income segregation, and urban redevelopment--and found that racial and ethnic residential patterns are related strongly to the spatial separation of poor persons. The relationship between income segregation and spatial separation of the poor is not significant however. We also found that the relationship between urban redevelopment and spatial separation of the poor pertains only to blacks. These findings suggest that blacks are vulnerable in the process of urban redevelopment.},

  abstract = {We used the 1991 Canadian census to examine the extent of spatial separation of the poor in Canadian cities. ALthough there were no extensive areas of blight, decay, or housing abandonment, we found high spatial separation of poor visible minorities in the selected cities. The index of dissimilarity indicates high segregation of poor blacks and moderate separation of poor Asians from the nonpoor population. We tested the effects of three major structural factors--racial and ethnic segregation, income segregation, and urban redevelopment--and found that racial and ethnic residential patterns are related strongly to the spatial separation of poor persons. The relationship between income segregation and spatial separation of the poor is not significant however. We also found that the relationship between urban redevelopment and spatial separation of the poor pertains only to blacks. These findings suggest that blacks are vulnerable in the process of urban redevelopment.},

  abstract = {With the rise of the cognitive-cultural (or knowledge) economy, urban areas around the world have experienced significant changes in their social geographies. Studentification is one such change that has occurred in cities hosting major universities around the world. This study extends the analysis of social change to vital knowledge nodes in the networked global economy: United States college towns. K-means cluster analysis is used to identify neighborhood types in ten cities with major research universities across four Census years: 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010. Temporal and spatial analyses are then conducted to determine how these knowledge nodes have changed with the decline of the industrial economy and the rise of the knowledge economy. The analysis indicates the presence of six neighborhood types in these college towns: Middle Class, Minority-Concentrated, Stability, Elite, Mix/Renter, and Student. Over the course of the study period, the number of Elite neighborhoods increased considerably, while the number of Middle Class neighborhoods plummeted. The number of Mix/Renter neighborhoods also increased. Spatially, Student and Minority-Concentrated neighborhoods generally remained fairly clustered in the same areas across the study period. Elite neighborhoods spread across wider geographical areas over the course of the study period. These results are compared to previous studies on neighborhood change. The comparisons reveal that the knowledge nodes show some similar patterns to studentifying cities and to rapidly growing nodes in areas with ties to the global knowledge economy.},

We revisit the seminal paper by Tolbert and Sizer and demonstrate the sensitivity of definitions to two features of the methodology: a cluster dissimilarity cut-off, or the count of clusters, and uncertainty in the input data. We show how these features impact empirical estimates using a standard application of commuting zones and an example from related literature. We conclude with advice to researchers on how to demonstrate the robustness of empirical findings to uncertainty in the definition of commuting zones.},

In particular, courts ruled that the shape of these districts-which they characterized as "bizarre" and noncompact-demonstrated that states had unconstitutionally classified voters by race. These legal cases reflect a fundamental tension in American political culture between universalistic citizenship and particularistic racial identity. Universalistic concepts that embrace numeric political representation, geometric standards of shape, and the "liberal self" share an understanding of the individual as the basic unit of political representation and define this individual by the ability to make rational choices. In contrast, concepts of particularistic identity that emphasize the importance of "regional community representation," informal visual standards of shape, and place-based or regional attachments view communities as the basic unit of political representation, and believe that individual identity is primarily constituted by membership in communities. Although some participants in the redistricting litigation have advocated notions of community based on racial solidarity, federal courts have only recognized such claims to the extent that these communities are defined by regional attachments. This suggests that the importance of regional attachments remains firmly entrenched in the American political system, despite the ascendance of "placeless" numeric representation. Notwithstanding the impassioned rhetoric on both sides, the effect of these cases is ambiguous for two reasons. First, the creation of nonwhite majority districts is a problematic strategy of political empowerment; second, the decisions do not directly address the underlying issues of segregation and racial inequality.

Our findings temper and in some instances contradict Laurie and Jaggi's claim that expanding `vision', the size of the immediate neighbourhood households consider when evaluating residential ethnic mix, makes stable integration a likely outcome in Schelling-like models with weak-to-moderate preferences. We note several reasons why our results differ from Laurie and Jaggi's. The most important of these is that Laurie and Jaggi underestimate the segregation-producing potential of weak-tomoderate preferences because they overlook a powerful interaction between preferences and ethnic demography and perform their simulations using the optimal ethnic mix for achieving integration. We show that the preferences Laurie and Jaggi describe as compatible with stable integration generate high levels of segregation in their model under settings for ethnic demography common in real cities.},

The nature of this paradox, its origins, and the means of transcending it are illustrated primarily through an analysis of Marx's theory of metabolic rift, which, it is contended, offers important classical foundations for environmental sociology.},

These analyses estimated the effects on producers, agricultural production levels, transportation providers, highway and railroad infrastructure costs, and changes in fuel efficiency and emissions because of transportation mode shifts, based on a single least-cost transportation model (LCTM) that simulated the transportation patterns for wheat and barley in eastern Washington. An LCTM, such as the one used in these studies, can answer many of the critical questions about the effects of major changes to transportation systems and their users. Given its flexibility and sophistication, LCTM is an appropriate tool for predictive modeling when decision makers must consider the costs and benefits of a proposed transportation project or system modification. Although agricultural economists often use LCTM in their research, few transportation planning analysts apply this tool. The application of LCTM to transportation planning is illustrated by analyzing the economic effects likely resulting from changes to the transportation system in the Pacific Northwest related to the proposed breaching of four dams on the Snake River.},

Specifically, it is impossible for firms to make decisions about production levels without knowing exactly what every other firm will do and where labor will be available. This finding suggests some new directions for the development of dynamic spatial-economic models that can operate outside of equilibrium.},

This article introduces the idea of leakage to describe the minute inaccuracies in optimization that can cascade into major shifts in outcomes. This leakage plays an increasingly important role when the population is evenly spread among cities. Furthermore, as other assumptions are relaxed the effects of leakage on model stability are multiplied. This finding is of particular interest as the equilibrium-based results of geographical economics are increasingly being applied in policy settings where moderate concentrations of population and heterogeneity are the norm rather than the exception.},

This article seeks to understand the degree to which economic clusters are associated with lower poverty rates. Specifically, using spatial regression analysis techniques, we examine patterns that link clusters to poverty rates while controlling for the presence of other factors that shape the distribution of poverty in the United States. When controlling for other economic and demographic factors in a multivariate framework, the presence of industrial clusters is associated with lower poverty rates. Moreover, regions with a higher share of employment in clusters, and with that employment dispersed across many industries within the same cluster, fare even better than those where employment is concentrated in a single industry. Furthermore, while there is evidence that particular clusters are associated with significantly altered poverty rates, not all of these associations are beneficial.},

We also provide a set of tools for comparing delineations across methods and over time. In presenting our revised delineations, we shed light on the role of expert opinion in the original delineations, the strengths and weaknesses of the original method, and offer suggestions for further revision of this tool that may better reflect the theo- retical conception of commuting zones.},

With the methodological tools now available, we need a conceptual shift in how we view population measures in order to bring our theories and measures of neighborhoods into alignment. I argue that segregation can be beneficially viewed as multiscalar; not a value calculable at some ``correct'' scale, but a continuous function with respect to scale. This shift requires new ways of thinking about and analyzing segregation with respect to scale that engage with the complexity of the multiscalar measure.

Drawing on 1980{\textendash}2010 decennial census data, we use a new visual tool to compare the distributions of place diversity for 50 U.S. metro areas over three decades. We also undertake a decomposition analysis of segregation within these areas to evaluate hypotheses about the roles of different types of places in ethnoracial change. The decomposition indicates that although principal cities continue to shape the overall diversity of metro areas, their relative impact has declined since 1980. Inner suburbs have experienced substantial increases in diversity during the same period. Places with large white majorities now contribute more to overall metropolitan diversity than in the past. In contrast, majority black and majority Hispanic places contribute less to metropolitan diversity than in the past. The complexity of the patterns we observe is underscored through an inspection of two featured metropolises: Chicago and Dallas.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, The Author(s) 2018. Multiscale segregation measures have the potential to increase understanding of residential context and ultimately a wide range of social and spatial processes. By examining segregation at multiple scales, we have the opportunity to study it as more than the outcome of a single process or a measure describing a single contextual effect. Multiscale segregation encourages us to look for sorting processes and contextual effects operating at different scales and potentially even with different meanings. However, the complexity of multiscale measures introduces significant uncertainty about the role of underlying data and assumptions in producing observed outcomes, particularly at fine geographic scales. While traditional measures of segregation have been exposed to decades of scrutiny, multiscale measures are still relatively novel and less well understood. The theoretical contribution of this paper is to consider the implications of segregation as both an outcome and signifier of sorting processes at multiple scales. The empirical contribution is to consider how zoning and the degree of spatial association shape outcomes expressed as multiscale segregation measures. I examine the effects of different allocation strategies for measuring population at small scales by comparing four delineation methods. I find that the method chosen for allocating population to small areas matters, but that by the time observation units reach about 700 m 2 most of the difference between methods has washed out. I also test the effect of changing the degree of assumed spatial association in generating multiscale segregation measures. I find that, as suggested by Reardon and O'Sullivan in their original exposition of their spatial segregation measure, this assumption has a relatively small effect on outcomes and is unlikely to shape substantive findings.},

Because the ACS is based on a relatively small sample of the population commuting flows are represented as point estimates, frequently with high margins of error. In this paper we examine the impact of uncertainty in commuting flows on these two critical designations. We find that, for the vast majority of counties (85\%) and tracts (87\%), the official designation remains consistent and that, in over 1,000 replications of the data, 98\% of county assignments and 97\% of tract assignments were consistent with the official delineations. While these results are reassuring, a small number of counties and tracts do experience assignments that are different from the official delineation at very high rates. We also test the official delineations against an alternative data source, the Longitudinal Employer- Household Dynamics Survey's Origin{\textendash}Destination Employment Statistics (LEHD-LODES). We find the LODES data result in designations that are largely consistent with those from the ACS but we lack a clear way to choose between the data products in places where they differ. Overall, our findings suggest that the current delineation method for assigning counties to CBSAs and tracts to RUCA codes is sufficiently robust to uncertainty to continue going forward.

Here I examine 65.3 million registration records from10 states to trace individual-level participation before and after the 2012 round of redistricting, testing whether a shift in congressional representation, candidacy, and/or district ethnic composition affected an individual's decision to participate. Separating results for non-Hispanicwhite, black, Latino, andAsianAmerican registrants, I find that individuals change their behavior in response to ethnoracial context, with African Americans more likely to vote when assigned to majority-black districts with black candidates or incumbents. White and Asian registrants also turn out in higher numbers when a co-ethnic candidate is on the ballot, but Latinos may be less likely to vote in the short term when assigned to majority-Latino districts.}

Due to the intertwined nature of how these factors affect educational politics in suburban districts, we draw on Hirschman's exit-voice-loyalty framework to examine factors influencing residential and education decisions. Drawing on in-depth fieldwork in seven multiracial suburban districts, this article examines how, and whether, the way in which districts define issues related to increasing diversity shapes the actions they take. The article also examines how district jurisdiction affects the implementation of diversity policies as well as the policies themselves. We argue that policymakers' decision making, both due to the pressure of exit to less diverse suburban districts and the rising voices of more advantag...},

A steep decline in white, school-age children and an increase in black, Hispanic, and Asian children in both neighborhoods and the schools that serve them suggests that white households reluctant to send their children to diversifying schools are exiting (or never entering) these districts entirely rather than sorting within them. AZB changes, often due to the opening of new schools, affect a large portion of both districts, but boundary changes are associated with only a small portion of increased segregation observed in both schools and neighborhoods between 1990 and 2010. Our findings speak to the complex, multidirectional relationships between demographic trends and AZBs in diversifying, growing suburbs.},

For migration researchers, the new survey offers the possibility of more frequently gathered migration data at a variety of spatial scales, along with annual information about the characteristics of migrants themselves. As with any shift in a data-collection process, however, the ACS could, in some aspects, fall short of what we already have. In this article, the authors first suggest elements of the ideal migration data set. They then examine the real potential, and the possible perils, of the ACS as compared to migration data researchers are already accustomed to working with. In addition to highlighting what the new ACS will (and will not) offer, the authors suggest that now is the time for regional scientists to address their basic migration data needs and to take action to ensure those needs are met.},

This is ironic, as urban shrinkage or depopulation is by nature a demographic phenomenon: city sizes evolve precisely because people move in and out, are born, and die. Moreover, the demographic processes that contribute to shrinking cities{\textemdash}out-migration and death{\textemdash}are selective and so they also govern who remains behind in cities as they shrink. It is this latter group that is the focus of this research. The analysis contributes to the literature on shrinking cities through its novel consideration of community-level exposure to depopulation. In particular, it investigates who is impacted by loss; the extent to which population loss is experienced disproportionately across urban space and demographic subgroups; and whether decline occurring at multiple spatial scales magnifies exposure for some groups more than others. Findings show that, at both city and census tract levels, demographic characteristics of growth and loss areas are different and, at all levels, some groups are more likely than others to be living in a loss-impacted area.},

Drawing on postcolonial geographical thought, this article interrogates HOPE VI as a colonial project. Through the displacement of public housing residents, the razing of the development in which they lived, and the rebuilding of mixed-income housing, including new public housing units, HOPE VI projects seek to revitalize neighborhoods by attracting higher-income homeowners to relocate in these areas. Proponents of HOPE VI and other mixed-income housing strategies contend that socioeconomic mixing will provide a range of benefits for low-income residents in these environments. Yet, there is a growing body of research suggesting that income mixing itself can be a problem for public housing residents because the neighborhood social relations operate to marginalize them. Using a case study conducted in a midsized southern city, we build on this prior work by examining the sociospatial narratives that neighbors surrounding the HOPE VI site use to identify themselves. The article focuses on how new homeowners, residing in a self-contained development right across the street from a HOPE VI site, construct themselves as a community by situating public housing residents as their other. We conclude that these sociospatial distinctions are integral to the broader, state-led effort to colonize and transform this low-income neighborhood situated next to the downtown business district.},

The historical review in the first part of the article shows such entry to have been exceedingly rare during the twentieth century. Our analysis of trends in white entry into black neighborhoods for the period 1980-2010 documents a substantial increase in white entry for the 2000-10 decade. We speculate that the increase in white entry into black neighborhoods was due to declining racism among whites and dramatically declining crime rates in the 1990s. We also use multivariate regression to explain which black neighborhoods were most likely to experience an influx of whites. Factors associated with gentrification appear to offer the most promising explanations. We discuss the implications of these findings in the conclusion.},

  abstract = {This report seeks to evaluate selective migration processes of Hispanic and Asian nationality groups in the US from established settlement areas, using recent migration data from the American Community Survey. The underlying goal is to detect migration tendencies leading toward an increased dispersion of these groups associated with their migration processes. Using descriptive statistics, maps, and migration models, we assess how migration processes in the 2006-8 period are leading to the dispersal of Hispanic and Asian race ethnic groups across metropolitan areas, with special attention to the roles of co-ethnic communities and spatial assimilation. These analyses employ migration data available from the 3-year 2006-8 American Community Survey using restricted data from the US Census Bureau's Research Data Centers. This use of the restricted ACS files permitted the first post 2000 analysis of inter-metropolitan migration for Hispanic groups (Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Salvadorans, Dominicans) and Asian groups (Chinese, Indians, Filipinos, Vietnamese, Koreans) using the detailed demographic and geographic attributes available with these files. The data and analysis presented here provide a benchmark for further research of this kind with the American Community Survey in light of the fact that migration data will no longer be available from the US decennial census. The study examines migration from these groups' major settlement areas to other metropolitan area destinations as they are affected by the attraction of co-ethnic communities and by a migrant selectivity pattern consistent with the perspective of spatial assimilation. The migration processes themselves were evaluated in terms of two components: the out--migration rates of residents, and the destination selection of movers. From the perspective of co-ethnic community attraction, it was hypothesized that the outmigration rates from high co-ethnic settlement areas would be lower than those from areas where the group had a smaller overall presence and that the destination selections of out-migrants would be positively affected by the presence of high co-ethnic population shares in destination areas. From the spatial assimilation perspective, it was hypothesized that out-migration from high coethnic areas would least likely occur for group members with lowest education, poor facility with English, and recently arrived in the US; whereas the selection of destinations with large coethnic population shares would be most likely to occur for these same population categories. The results strongly confirm that co-ethnic community attraction continues to reduce outmigration of groups from major settlement origins and positively influences their destination selections. A series of multivariate migrant destination selection models confirm a consistent draw of ethnically similar destinations across individual Hispanic and Asian groups when other economic, demographic and structural metropolitan attributes are taken into account. In contrast, results regarding spatial assimilation are typically mixed or nonexistent in characterizing both out-migration and mover destination selectivity patterns. In fact, we find contrary evidence for some Asian groups for whom it is the most educated, and native born migrants who show a penchant for selecting destinations with greater co-ethnic population shares. Among the greatest destinations for Indians, for example, are Philadelphia, Seattle, Dallas, Boston and Atlanta- areas with higher than average Indian population shares, and areas that also house knowledge-based industries. The selection of co-ethnic destinations among Hispanic group migrants appears somewhat impervious to education attainment and Hispanic and Mexican group movers, who are foreign born and who arrived since 2000, are least, rather than most, prone to select co-ethnic destinations. The mover destination models make plain that employment growth at destination provides a strong draw for all Hispanic groups. This suggests that recent growth in low skilled jobs in parts of the country with small Hispanic populations are nonetheless attracting newly arrived, and less skilled Mexicans and other Hispanics who might have previously been especially lured to destinations with large co-ethnic population shares.},

Surprisingly, no study has explicitly documented the segregation of minority owners and renters from whites. Using data from Census 2000, this study aims to fill this gap. Analyses here reveal that the segregation of black renters relative to whites is significantly lower than the segregation of black owners from whites, controlling for relevant socioeconomic and demographic factors, contrary to the notion that homeownership represents an endpoint in the residential assimilation process. The patterns for Hispanics and Asians conform more to expectations under the spatial assimilation model. The findings here suggest that race and ethnicity continue to be as important in shaping residential segregation as socioeconomic status, and raise concerns about the benefits of homeownership, particularly for blacks.},

Using longitudinal neighborhood crime data from six U.S. cities during the national crime decline, this article examines changes in (1) crime rates of neighborhoods grouped by their initial crime levels, poverty rates, and racial/ethnic makeups; (2) the neighborhood exposure to violence of urban residents classified by race/ethnicity and poverty status; and (3) the relative distribution of violent crime across urban neighborhoods. We find that crime levels declined the most in the initially most violent and disadvantaged neighborhoods and that exposure to violence fell the most among disadvantaged urban residents. Nonetheless, crime remained concentrated in cities' initially most violent and disadvantaged locales.},

This paper identifies twenty manufacturing industry clusters from a principal components analysis of interindustry patterns of trade and measures the spatial employment concentration of each cluster?s plants within a polycentric framework. Two to eight centers of employment concentration are detected within the Southern California region for each set of trade linkages. Our spatial half-life measure reveals that half of a cluster?s employment in associated establishments is located within a typical range of eight to twelve kilometers (about 5?7.5 miles) to the nearest employment center or subcenter for the particular cluster. Furthermore, employment in seventeen of the twenty clusters is found to be more spatially concentrated than manufacturing employment as a whole, suggesting that geographic proximity is important to interindustry linkages in the Southern California economy. More important, the spatial concentration across industry clusters varies considerably within the metropolitan area, implying that economic development practitioners should consider local context and adapt industry cluster theories to the specific advantages and disadvantages of their immediate locality.},

Existing research suggests, however, that there are tensions between the spatial distribution of voluntary resources and welfare needs, and that the relationship between voluntary activity and active citizenship is more complex than is often acknowledged. Focusing on the voluntary welfare sector in Glasgow, the authors first examine the uneven distribution of voluntary activity across the city and its relationship to 'need'. Although in contrast to previous research this reveals strong representation of voluntary organisations in deprived areas of the city (largely as a result of state funding programmes), important tensions and conflicts remain between where organisations are funded to provide services and the needs of vulnerable populations. In the second part of the paper the relationship between voluntarism and citizenship in Glasgow is examined. Highlighting the existence of a distinction between 'grass-roots' and 'corporatist' voluntary organisations, the authors illustrate the ways in which voluntarism can be associated with both the empowerment and the disempowerment of citizens. In the conclusions it is emphasised that developments in Glasgow resonate with wider concerns about the impact of welfare reform on the voluntary sector.},

Further analysis focused on whether high competitive workforce growth between 1990 and 2000 translated into high competitive employment growth from 1999 to 2003. The results show that many of the areas with the highest competitive growth rates of creative economy employment from 1999 to 2003 were some of the weakest regions in terms of creative workforce growth during the 1990s. This raises questions about the extent to which jobs follow people in the creative economy, and suggests that an initial strong presence in the creative economy is not a prerequisite for future growth.},

Empirical findings indicate that the performance of the creative economy varied widely across the U.S., and that the highest competitive growth rates of the creative workforce occurred in the Rocky Mountain, Southeast, and Southwest regions. Further analysis focused on whether high competitive workforce growth between 1990 and 2000 translated into high competitive employment growth from 1999 to 2003. The results show that many of the areas with the highest competitive growth rates of creative economy employment from 1999 to 2003 were some of the weakest regions in terms of creative workforce growth during the 1990s. This raises questions about the extent to which jobs follow people in the creative economy, and suggests that an initial strong presence in the creative economy is not a prerequisite for future growth.},

  abstract = {Marriage and cohabitation between members of different racial and ethnic groups has increased in the United States over recent decades. Despite this demographic shift, we know relatively little about how the growing numbers of mixed-race couples are faring in systems of residential stratification. Previous research indicates that mixed-race couples tend to be located in diverse neighborhoods, but because this past research has used cross-sectional data and has not focused on actual residential mobility, it is not clear whether mixed-race couples choose diverse neighborhoods or are just more likely to develop in diverse neighborhoods. To provide a more complete picture of this topic, I conduct a prospective analysis of the residential location and mobility patterns of mixed-race couples, focusing on the extent to which these couples are more likely than monoracial couples to move into, and/or remain in, diverse neighborhoods. The use of longitudinal data between 1985 and 2009 from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) linked to neighborhood- and metropolitan-level data from multiple population censuses reveals that in comparison with monoracial couples, mixed-race couples tend to be located in neighborhoods with higher levels of racial and ethnic diversity and tend to enter more diverse residential destinations when they move. However, these outcomes vary substantially across types of mixed-race couples. Moreover, the outcomes associated with individual- and metropolitan-level conditions provide limited support for the common contention that the residential patterns of mixed-race couples reflect differences in residential preferences, and point to the role of broader patterns of racial stratification in shaping their residential outcomes.},

We developed fictitious female white and Arab American identities and used the audit method to respond to 560 roommate-wanted advertisements in four metro areas: Los Angeles, New York, Detroit, and Houston. To focus on social--rather than purely economic--biases, all responses identified the sender as college-educated and employed and were written in grammatically correct English. We compare the number of replies received, finding that Arab-origin names receive about 40 percent fewer replies. We then model variation in discrimination rates by proximity to mosques, geographic concentration of mosques, and the percentage of Arabs living in a census tract so as to test ethnic competition theory and the contact hypothesis. In Los Angeles and New York, greater discrimination occurred in neighborhoods with the highest concentration of mosques.},

There follows a discussion of how this 'composite commodity' definition relates to the planning challenge of spatially bounding neighbourhood. The paper then probes the myriad idiosyncrasies associated with the concept of neighbourhood: cross-attribute variation in durability and ability to be priced, relativistic evaluations of attributes and consumption impacts on attributes. It discusses how, within this new paradigmatic context, neighbourhoods are produced by the same actors that consume them: households, property owners, business people and local government. Finally, consideration is given to various aspects of the origins and nature of neighbourhood change and it is argued that neighbourhood dynamics are rife with social inefficiencies.},

The paper describes these challenges, prior attempts to meet them, and their respective shortcomings. It notes several approaches on the horizon that offer the promise of surmounting these challenges: experiments with varied scales of bespoke neighbourhoods; databases with multi-domain measures of neighbourhood characteristics; statistical models testing for non-linear neighbourhood effects that are stratified by residential group, density of local social interactions, and duration of residency; and econometric devices involving instrumental variables and residuals. It argues that further progress can be made on this front if we take advantage of natural quasi-experiments and push toward fielding a major, new social survey employing a people/place panel design.

The present study examines the extent to which residential proximity to a documented source of airborne lead is associated with intellectual and executive function in children. Data were available for n = 849 children from the Family Life Project. Geolocation for children's residences between birth and 36 months were referenced against the Environmental Protection Agency's Risk Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) database, which estimates exposure for each {$\frac{1}{2}$} mile grid in the contiguous United States. Instrumental variable models were employed to estimate causal associations between exposure and cognitive outcomes measured at 36, 48, and 60 months, using census-documented density of manufacturing employment as the instrument. Models of continuous lead dosage indicated small negative effects for both child IQ and executive function (EF). These results indicate that RSEI estimates of airborne lead exposure are meaningfully associated with decrements in cognitive development.},

  abstract = {Background:~         Evidence for a causal relationship between traffic-related air pollution and asthma has not been consistent across studies, and comparisons among studies have been difficult because of the use of different indicators of exposure.         Methods:~         We examined the association between traffic-related pollution and childhood asthma in 208 children from 10 southern California communities using multiple indicators of exposure. Study subjects were randomly selected from participants in the Children's Health Study. Outdoor nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was measured in summer and winter outside the home of each child. We also determined residential distance to the nearest freeway, traffic volumes on roadways within 150 meters, and model-based estimates of pollution from nearby roadways.         Results:~         Lifetime history of doctor-diagnosed asthma was associated with outdoor NO2; the odds ratio (OR) was 1.83 (95\% confidence interval = 1.04{\textendash}3.22) per increase of 1 interquartile range (IQR = 5.7 ppb) in exposure. We also observed increased asthma associated with closer residential distance to a freeway (1.89 per IQR; 1.19{\textendash}3.02) and with model-based estimates of outdoor pollution from a freeway (2.22 per IQR; 1.36{\textendash}3.63). These 2 indicators of freeway exposure and measured NO2 concentrations were also associated with wheezing and use of asthma medication. Asthma was not associated with traffic volumes on roadways within 150 meters of homes or with model-based estimates of pollution from nonfreeway roads.         Conclusions:~         These results indicate that respiratory health in children is adversely affected by local exposures to outdoor NO2 or other freeway-related pollutants.},

  abstract = {It is important, if not essential, to integrate the computations and code used in data analyses, methodological descriptions, simulations, and so on with the documents that describe and rely on them. This integration allows readers to both verify and adapt the claims in the documents. Authors can easily reproduce the results in the future, and they can present the document's contents in a different medium, for example, with interactive controls. This article describes a software framework for both authoring and distributing these integrated, dynamic documents that contain text, code, data, and any auxiliary content needed to recreate the computations. The documents are dynamic in that the contents{\textemdash}including figures, tables, and so on{\textemdash}can be recalculated each time a view of the document is generated. Our model treats a dynamic document as a master or ``source'' document from which one can generate different views in the form of traditional, derived documents for different audiences. We introduce the concept of a compendium as a container for one or more dynamic documents and the different elements needed when processing them, such as code and data. The compendium serves as a means for distributing, managing, and updating the collection. The step from disseminating analyses via a compendium to reproducible research is a small one. By reproducible research, we mean research papers with accompanying software tools that allow the reader to directly reproduce the results and employ the computational methods that are presented in the research paper. Some of the issues involved in paradigms for the production, distribution, and use of such reproducible research are discussed.},

We present a model of voting in double-member district elections with two majority candidates and one minority candidate and consider the voting equilibria under straight and cumulative voting. In straight voting, while an equilibrium always exists in which the two majority candidates are expected to win the two seats, minority candidates may be elected. In cumulative voting, minority candidate wins are also possible in equilibrium but are less likely when minority voters prefer one majority candidate over another. We then present experimental evidence showing that minority candidates win significantly more seats in cumulative than in straight voting elections. When minority voters perceive a substantial difference between the majority candidates, however, they are more likely to split their votes between the minority and majority candidates, winning fewer seats.},

This allows us to give a precise characterisation of some of the main theoretical underpinnings of urban agglomeration economies, to discuss modelling issues that arise when working with these tools, and to compare different sources of agglomeration economies in terms of the aggregate urban outcomes they produce as well as in terms of their normative implications.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether estimates of active and disabled life expectancy differ on the basis of neighborhood disadvantage after accounting for individual-level socioeconomic characteristics and other prognostic factors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective longitudinal cohort study included 754 nondisabled community-living persons, aged 70 years or older, who were members of the Precipitating Events Project in south central Connecticut from March 1998 to June 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Disability in 4 essential activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, walking, and transferring) was assessed each month. Scores on the Area Deprivation Index, a census-based socioeconomic measure with 17 education, employment, housing quality, and poverty indicators, were obtained through linkages with the 2000 Neighborhood Atlas. Area Deprivation Index scores were dichotomized at the 80th state percentile to distinguish neighborhoods that were disadvantaged (81-100) from those that were not (1-80). RESULTS Among the 754 participants, the mean (SD) age was 78.4 (5.3) years, and 487 (64.6\%) were female. Within 5-year age increments from 70 to 90, active life expectancy was consistently lower in participants from neighborhoods that were disadvantaged vs not disadvantaged, and these differences persisted and remained statistically significant after adjustment for individual-level race and ethnicity, education, income, and other prognostic factors. At age 70 years, adjusted estimates (95\% CI) for active life expectancy (in years) were 12.3 (11.5-13.1) in the disadvantaged group and 14.2 (13.5-14.7) in the nondisadvantaged group. At each age, participants from disadvantaged neighborhoods spent a greater percentage of their projected remaining life disabled, relative to those from nondisadvantaged neighborhoods, with adjusted values (SE) ranging from 17.7 (0.8) vs 15.3 (0.5) at age 70 years to 55.0 (1.7) vs 48.1 (1.3) at age 90 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, living in a disadvantaged neighborhood was associated with lower active life expectancy and a greater percentage of projected remaining life with disability. By addressing deficiencies in resource-poor environments, new or expanded social and public health initiatives have the potential to improve the functional well-being of community-living older persons and, in turn, reduce health disparities in the US.},

  abstract = {Most U.S. school districts draw ``attendance boundaries'' to define catchment areas that assign students to schools near their homes, often recapitulating neighborhood demographic segregation in schools. Focusing on elementary schools, we ask: How much might we reduce school segregation by redrawing attendance boundaries? Combining parent preference data with methods from combinatorial optimization, we simulate alternative boundaries for 98 U.S. school districts serving over 3 million elementary-age students, minimizing White/non-White segregation while mitigating changes to travel times and school sizes. Across districts, we observe a median 14\% relative decrease in segregation, which we estimate would require approximately 20\% of students to switch schools and, surprisingly, a slight reduction in travel times. We release a public dashboard depicting these alternative boundaries and invite both school boards and their constituents to evaluate their viability. Our results show the possibility of greater integration without significant disruptions for families.},

These older generations are highly participatory for both generational and life-cycle reasons, but the enormous post-Boomer age cohorts show signs of being less participatory. These generalizations about political activity within age cohorts raise questions about the extent to which local turnout levels are affected by the relative size of these groups in local electorates. We find that aggregate local turnout is highly sensitive to the age distribution, rising with the percentage over age 60, falling sharply with increases in the percentage between age 18 and 29. We find the greatest effects in those counties with the highest population growth rates, and we argue that the age gap between the general population and the active electorate will be greatest in these fast-growing locales.

We devise a survey experiment where respondents are shown photographs of properties and information about the local socioeconomic environment. By providing and varying additional information about the neighborhood partisan composition, our survey experiment explores how political information affects property evaluation. We find that the same property will be evaluated more favorably by partisans when they learn that it is situated in a predominantly co-partisan neighborhood. A second experiment examines how people make judgments about neighborhood partisan composition in the absence of readily available information. We learn that correct inferences about the politics of a locale can be drawn from non-political information about it, even without exposure to direct information about its partisan balance.},

In recognition of the significant economic, social and environmental costs of sprawl, a new smart growth paradigm of higher-density, mixed-use and transit-oriented urban centres has emerged in many metropolitan areas. A case study of Denver, Colorado, shows that the smart growth approach has been more effective than previous initiatives to change the development pattern and address the costs of sprawl. With many new urbanist projects and an aggressive transit-oriented development programme, Denver is offering a different urban alternative to its sprawling past. A broader coalition of support, especially including the development community, has characterised smart growth efforts in contrast to previous growth control initiatives. New forms of regional collaboration have contributed to a stronger regional identity, less jurisdictional infighting and greater consensus on issues of regional importance.},

  abstract = {Research on immigrant and second generation outcomes has often examined their locations, following ideas that geographic dispersion facilitates social mobility, and that characteristics of the ethnic environment enable or constrain progress. I contend that second generation socioeconomic outcomes depend in part on the location choices and characteristics of a previous immigrant generation. Further, I suggest that this relationship reflects the changing geography of immigrants and labour markets, rather than geographically unfolding assimilation. Using the 1940, 1970, and 2000 Integrated Public Use Microdata Series files from the US Census, I regress second and 1.5 generation wage and educational outcomes in 1970 and 2000 on metro-area characteristics of a previous generation (1940 and 1970, respectively). Current labour market and second generation characteristics are included as controls and to facilitate interpretation. Characteristics of a previous immigrant generation's location were more important for second generation outcomes in the 19401970 period, while current place characteristics become more significant by 2000. There is evidence of selection operating through the positive intergenerational effects of places where immigrants' educational levels were high a generation ago. Metro-level immigrant concentration and manufacturing employment also have generally positive effects, although variations across generations and by nationality suggest their significance for social mobility is inadequately understood. The historical immigrant geographies of the US, and the ways in which metro labour market conditions intersect with immigrants' locational choices, both within and between generations, are thus a critical piece of the economic and spatial assimilation puzzle.},

Personal knowledge networks, though, mostly are perceived as homogenous, cohesive, and local personal ties. Moreover, a functionalist tone seems to prevail in accounts in which personal knowledge networks are seen to compensate the shortcomings of the formal organization. This paper sets out to expand the dominant construal of networks, which is largely molded by the notion of embeddedness. Against the background of in-depth empirical analysis of the project ecologies of the Hamburg advertising and the Munich software business, the paper will first venture into the neglected sphere of thin, ephemeral, and global personal knowledge networks by differentiating between connectivity, sociality, and communality networks. Second, the paper not only elucidates the supportive functions of these ties but also explores the tensions between personal interests, project goals, and the firm's aims that are induced by these personal knowledge networks.},

The products are complementary in the sense that they measure similar activities but each has important unique characteristics that provide information that the other measure cannot.

As a general rule, the two data products should not be expected to match exactly for arbitrary queries and may differ substantially for some queries. Within this document, we compare the two data products by the design elements that were deemed most likely to contribute to differences in tabulated data.

  abstract = {After Hurricane Katrina, socioeconomically vulnerable populations were slow to return to their poor and segregated pre-disaster neighborhoods. Yet, very little is known about the quality of their post-disaster neighborhoods. While vulnerable groups rarely escape neighborhood poverty, some Katrina evacuees showed signs of neighborhood improvement. The current study investigates this puzzle and the significance of long-distance moves for neighborhood change among participants in the Resilience in the Survivors of Katrina Project. Seven hundred low-income, mostly minority mothers in community college in New Orleans before Katrina were tracked across the country a year and a half later. The findings show that respondents' immediate and extended neighborhoods and metropolitan areas after Katrina were less disadvantaged, less organizationally isolated, and more racially and ethnically diverse compared to their pre-hurricane environments, and to the environments of those staying or returning home. Counterfactual analyses showed that more than within-neighborhood changes over time, between-neighborhood mobility and long-distance migration decreased respondents' exposures to distress in their neighborhood, extended geographic area, and metropolitan area.},

Our variant of empirical Bayesian kriging (EBK) is a fast and reliable solution for both automatic and interactive data interpolation. It can be used for interpolation of very large datasets up to billions of points. The following features are discussed: the informative prior distribution construction and usage; automatic data transformation of the dependent variable into a Gaussian distribution; data subsetting and merging the estimated models; and interpolation over large areas on the earth's surface. We conducted one simulation experiment and two case studies using highly variable data to investigate the EBK predicting quality.},

In Police and the Empire City Matthew Guariglia tells the history of the New York Police to show how its origins were built upon and inseparably entwined with the history of race, ethnicity, and whiteness in the United States. Guariglia explores the New York City Police Department through its periods of experimentation and violence as police experts import tactics from the US occupation of the Philippines and Cuba, devise modern bureaucratic techniques to better suppress Black communities, and infiltrate supposedly-unknowable immigrant neighborhoods. Innovations ranging from recruiting Chinese, Italian, or German police to form "ethnic squads," the use of deportation and federal immigration restrictions to control local crime-even the introduction of fingerprinting-were motivated by attempts to govern a multiracial city. Campaigns to remake the police department created an urban landscape where power, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, crime, and bodies collided and provided a foundation for the supposedly "colorblind," technocratic, federally-backed, and surveillance-based policing of today"--},

  abstract = {Redistricting is a complex and challenging spatial optimization problem. It is to group a set of spatial objects (such as counties) into a given number of geographically contiguous districts while satisfying multiple criteria and constraints such as equal population, compact shape, and more. The various criteria are often difficult to optimize and the number of potential solutions is very large. Moreover, many criteria are vaguely defined and may not be measured exactly. Therefore, human judgment and domain knowledge are indispensable and critical in the optimization process. In this paper, we present an interactive and computing-assisted approach to redistricting optimization. Our approach leverages the power of user's domain knowledge, judgment, and interactive exploration to (1) flexibly define various criteria/constraints, (2) visually and interactively examine alternative plans and achieve a balance among different criteria, and (3) efficiently and iteratively construct a collection of high-quality plans that are difficult to obtain with existing methods. A computational optimization algorithm is integrated to assist optimization under user-provided criteria and constraints. With the visual analytics approach, a user can quickly derive high-quality redistricting plans that satisfy both individual preferences and mandatory requirements. We demonstrate the capability of the approach and system with two case studies, Iowa congressional redistricting and South Carolina congressional redistricting. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Relevant identified migration flows are those that occur when a migrant only changes the place of permanent residence, and does not necessarily need to change workplace or most of the localities within a daily timespace context. The paper uses these migration data to delineate local migration areas (daily spatial systems) of the Czech Republic through the application of a standard rule-based procedure of functional regional taxonomy.},

  abstract = {This paper concerns the process of institutional change across regions in response to structural economic, social, political and technological change. It accepts as a starting point the assertion that institutional differences between regions account, at least in part, for differences in regional development outcomes. This raises the question of whether institutions in different locales will converge or diverge over time. The paper explores this question through a case study of institutional changes associated with the process of containerization at the Port of Baltimore. Despite considerable pressure for convergent change in various formal institutions, specifically with respect to port pricing and terminal leasing policies, important elements of a common-user approach to port operation were maintained. This particular trajectory of institutional change is reflective of both the local political economy, and the role of public officials deliberating over formal institutional choices in the face of considerable uncertainty. The evidence supports a notion of institutional transformation in which regional institutional diversity, albeit in new forms, is maintained.},

In the United States, the rural health disparity has been a recent focus of attention and made a priority for improvement. While many standardized definitions of urban and rural exist and are used by social scientists and demographers, they are found in sources unfamiliar to health researchers and have largely not been used in public health studies. This paper briefly reviews some available definitions of urban and rural for American geographic subunits and their respective strengths and weaknesses. For example, some definitions are better suited than others for capturing access to health care services. The authors applied different definitions to breast cancer incidence rates to show how urban/rural rate ratio comparisons would vary by choice of definition and found that dichotomous definitions may fail to capture variability in very rural areas. Further study of the utility of these measures in health studies is warranted.},

Using data on the 9.5 million visible foreclosures (public auctions and bank repossessions) occurring between 2005 and 2012, we show that the timing and depth of the foreclosure crisis differed considerably across regions and metropolitan areas, with those located in the Mountain and Pacific West regions experiencing the highest foreclosure risks. The crisis was patterned sharply along racial/ethnic lines, with metros and neighborhoods with large black and Latino populations--as well as racially mixed neighborhoods--having high rates of foreclosure. Our analysis also highlights the particular vulnerability of Latino households, who not only had very high individual risk of foreclosures but tended to reside in areas hit hardest by the crisis. The race-stratified geographic patterns of foreclosure revealed here are substantially more complicated than a narrative that depicts only the unique disadvantage of black households during the crisis, and likely reflect some level of specific targeting of minority populations and neighborhoods by predatory and subprime lenders.},

We find that the foreclosure crisis was patterned strongly along racial lines: black, Latino, and racially integrated neighborhoods had exceptionally high foreclosure rates. Multilevel models of racial/ethnic change reveal that foreclosure concentrations were linked to declining shares of whites and expanding shares of black and Latino residents. Results further suggest that these compositional shifts were driven by both white population loss and minority growth, especially from racially mixed settings with high foreclosure rates. To explore the impact of these racially selective migration streams on patterns of residential segregation, we simulate racial segregation assuming that foreclosure rates remained at their 2005 levels throughout the crisis period. Our simulations suggest that the foreclosure crisis increased racial segregation between blacks and whites by 1.1 dissimilarity points, and between Latinos and whites by 2.2 dissimilarity points.},

We posit three interrelated dynamics which explain the editorial board's interest in charter schools as part of a broader urban regime agenda. First, charter schools represent part of a neoliberal shift in education that parallels shifts in urban governance, emphasizing flexibility, public-private partnerships, and 'market'-oriented consumer choice and accountability. Second, the newspaper is issuing a challenge to educational structures, to adopt more neoliberal policies and shed a bureaucratic, liberal governance framework. Finally, we find critical evidence that the charter school movement draws on a multiscalar discourse which simultaneously references responsiveness to local, neighborhood needs, and at the same time highlights the economic imperatives of a global, competitive city to differentially skill students/workers in order to capture mobile and fractured (global) capital.},

EZs are a set of generous tax incentives and grants aimed at small, economically depressed areas of large U.S. cities. We find areas that border or are economically similar to EZ locations experience a decline in the number of establishments and employment compared to areas that border or are similar to rejected EZ applicants. We also demonstrate that using spillover prone areas to estimate program effects causes upward bias when the spillover is negative. We find that for many of our estimates, spillovers more than offset positive program effects, although there are instances when the net effect is small and positive.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Progress has been made recently in estimating ambient PM(2.5) (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter {$<$} 2.5 {$\mu$}m) and ozone concentrations using various data sources and advanced modeling techniques, which resulted in gridded surfaces. However, epidemiologic and health impact studies often require population exposures to ambient air pollutants to be presented at an appropriate census geographic unit (CGU), where health data are usually available to maintain confidentiality of individual health data. We aim to generate estimates of population exposures to ambient PM(2.5) and ozone for U.S. CGUs. METHODS We converted 2001-2006 gridded data, generated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for CDC's (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Environmental Public Health Tracking Network (EPHTN), to census block group (BG) based on spatial proximities between BG and its four nearest grids. We used a bottom-up (fine to coarse) strategy to generate population exposure estimates for larger CGUs by aggregating BG estimates weighted by population distribution. RESULTS The BG daily estimates were comparable to monitoring data. On average, the estimates deviated by 2 {$\mu$}g/m(3) (for PM(2.5)) and 3 ppb (for ozone) from their corresponding observed values. Population exposures to ambient PM(2.5) and ozone varied greatly across the U.S. In 2006, estimates for daily potential population exposure to ambient PM(2.5) in west coast states, the northwest and a few areas in the east and estimates for daily potential population exposure to ambient ozone in most of California and a few areas in the east/southeast exceeded the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for at least 7 days. CONCLUSIONS These estimates may be useful in assessing health impacts through linkage studies and in communicating with the public and policy makers for potential intervention.},

However, the presumed benefits but not the actual harm of the eminent domain actions typically eludes the working-class and low-income segments of the community that often shoulder the greatest consequences of the action. Municipal governments must be much more exacting, deliberative, and strategic in ensuring there is an obvious and direct connection between the potential economic development opportunities leveraged by eminent domain practices and the benefits, opportunities, and resources that the community derives from those transactions of local government. Thoughtfully and strategically designed and executed Community Benefit Agreements have tremendous potential to afford working-class and low-income residents, as well other city residents, a chance for more equitable and democratic results than they frequently experience under existing economic-development-driven eminent domain practice.},

Hourly link-based emissions and zone-based soak emissions were estimated. In addition, hourly roadway emissions were dispersed at a high spatial resolution and the resulting ambient air concentrations were linked with individual time-activity patterns derived from the model to assess person-level daily exposure. The method results in an explicit representation of the temporal and spatial variation in emissions, ambient air quality, and population exposure.},

Theories that emphasize the role of proximity and tacit knowledge in innovation processes highlight the importance of social interaction and networking for the diffusion of knowledge. A concept that captures the impact of human relations on economic activity is social capital. Using factorial analysis with data from the European Values Study (EVS), the multidimensionality of social capital is demonstrated empirically. The obtained independent dimensions serve as inputs in a knowledge production function estimated for a sample of European regions. One of the major results is that the impact of social capital on regional innovation processes is significant and comparable with the importance of human capital. However, not all dimensions of social capital exhibit the same explanatory power. The dimension 'Associational Activity' represents the strongest driving force for patenting activity. Hence, empirical evidence for the significance of weak ties in innovative processes is given.},

Past research has explored in detail the preferences people hold in terms of the racial and ethnic composition of their neighborhoods, and more recently some have also examined the correspondence between racial and ethnic neighborhood preferences and current neighborhood racial/ethnic composition. But an intermediate stage-the racial/ethnic composition of where people search-has not been investigated. We analyze a subsample (n = 382) from the 2004-2005 Chicago Area Study to demonstrate the value of systematically studying the matches-or mismatches-between preferences, search locations, and neighborhood outcomes. We find that for whites, not only their current neighborhoods but also the neighborhoods in which they search for housing have larger percentages of whites than they say they prefer. In contrast, blacks-and to a lesser extent Latinos-search in neighborhoods that correspond to their preferences, but reside in neighborhoods with a larger percentage own group. Logistic regression analyses reveal that mismatches are associated with both a lack of information and inadequate finances, but also may be due to socially desirable responding for whites in particular. Our results provide suggestive evidence of the importance of unpacking the search process more generally and draw attention to what are likely to be productive new future data collection efforts as well as an area potentially ripe for policy interventions.},

From analyses of diaspora to the plantation, from studies of urban segregation to anticolonial circuits of resistance, Black thought has long been concerned with questions of space, place, and power. Yet these interventions, which span centuries and continents, have not always been recognized as ``properly'' geographical and have thus been systematically excluded from the formal canon of disciplinary geography. Within the last five years, however, Black Geographies as a field of inquiry has gained increasing institutional recognition{\textemdash}thanks to the tireless labor of Black scholars to carve out spaces for their work within the discipline. This article reflects on the state of the field of Black Geographies, with an emphasis on the radically interdisciplinary interventions this body of scholarship has made into the mainstream of disciplinary geography. I review some of the most prominent thematic areas within Black Geographies, including space-making and the Black geographic imagination; racial capitalism; cities, policing, and carceral geographies; and racism and plantation futures. I conclude with a consideration of avenues for future research, including the need for more studies that provincialize North America and connect with Latinx and Native/Indigenous geographies.},

Scholars concerned with civic engagement have argued that there is a strong link between the informal ties known as "social capital" and citizen engagement in the larger community. If this linkage can be shown to exist in the neighborhood setting, then it can provide guidance to both scholars and practitioners in utilizing informal, place-based networks to empower disadvantaged neighborhoods. Evidence presented in this essay, based on interviews with a representative sample of neighborhood residents in the small industrial city of Waterloo, Iowa, suggests that strong informal networks of social capital exist within neighborhoods, but that persons who are more strongly engaged in these networks are not necessarily more involved in the efforts of formal neighborhood associations. However, individuals who are involved in these formal associations are much more likely to be connected to the local and national political systems through voting and other forms of participation.},

  abstract = {This case study examines the importance of neighborhood identity and engagement in place-based social networks within the neighborhood in fostering and stimulating neighborhood-based participation in the urban political process. Scholars concerned with civic engagement have argued that there is a strong link between the informal ties known as "social capital" and citizen engagement in the larger community. If this linkage can be shown to exist in the neighborhood setting, then it can provide guidance to both scholars and practitioners in utilizing informal, place-based networks to empower disadvantaged neighborhoods. Evidence presented in this essay, based on interviews with a representative sample of neighborhood residents in the small industrial city of Waterloo, Iowa, suggests that strong informal networks of social capital exist within neighborhoods, but that persons who are more strongly engaged in these networks are not necessarily more involved in the efforts of formal neighborhood associations. However, individuals who are involved in these formal associations are much more likely to be connected to the local and national political systems through voting and other forms of participation.},

Much focus has been on  neighbourhood effects' and on how spatial variations within the city affect individual careers. This paper adds the analysis of variations of labour market incorporation between cities. The labour market careers of one migrant cohort to Sweden are analysed, where the analysis of  neighbourhood effects' and  city effects' are studied jointly, using a longitudinal database and discrete-time event history analysis. The results show that labour market participation increases slowly over time and there are large variations due to migrant origin, gender and education. Both  neighbourhood effects' and  city effects' were significant, but whereas the former decreased over time, the  city effect' was robust. Accordingly, contextual aspects of the individual city need to be included in the analysis of neighbourhood effects.},

Therefore, a particular aggregation at a specific scale can yield an arbitrary result that is valid only for that specific delineation. This problem is called the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), and it has previously been shown to create issues in analyses of clusters and segregation patterns. Many analyses of segregation and clustering use the ratio or difference between a value for an areal unit and the corresponding value for a larger area of reference. We argue that the results of such an analysis can also be rendered arbitrary if one does not examine the effects of varying the geographical extent of the area of reference to test whether the analysis results are valid for more than a specific areal delineation. We call this the part of the MAUP that is related to the area of reference. In this article, we present and demonstrate a multiscalar approac...},

  abstract = {Increasingly, the widely established, globalisation-driven agenda of economic competitiveness meets a growing concern with sustainability. Yet, the practical and conceptual co-existence--or fusion--of these two agendas is not always easy. This includes finding and operationalising the  right' scale of governance, an important question for the pursuit of the distinctly transscalar nature of these two policy fields.  New regionalism' has increasingly been discussed as a pragmatic way of tackling the variable spatialities associated with these policy fields and their changing articulation. This paper introduces  smart (new) city-regionalism', derived from the principles of smart growth and new regionalism, as a policy-shaping mechanism and analytical framework. It brings together the rationales, agreed principles and legitimacies of publicly negotiated polity with collaborative, network-based and policy-driven spatiality. The notion of  smartness', as suggested here as central feature, goes beyond the implicit meaning of  smart' as in  smart growth'. When introduced in the later 1990s the term embraced a focus on planning and transport. Since then, the adjective  smart' has become used ever more widely, advocating innovativeness, participation, collaboration and co-ordination. The resulting  smart city regionalism' is circumscribed by the interface between the sectorality and territoriality of policy-making processes. Using the examples of Vancouver and Seattle, the paper looks at the effects of the resulting specific local conditions on adopting  smartness' in the scalar positioning of policy-making.},

This research reviews the state-of-the-art in applied transportation accessibility measurement and performs a comparative evaluation of software tools for calculating accessibility by walking and public transit including ArcGIS Pro, Emme, R5R, and OpenTripPlanner using R and Python, among others. Using a case study of Toronto, we specify both origin-based and regional-scale analysis scenarios and find significant differences in computation time and calculated accessibilities. While the calculated travel time matrices are highly correlated across tools, each tool produces different results for the same origin-destination pair. Comparisons of the estimated accessibilities also reveal evidence of spatial clustering in the ways paths are calculated by some tools relative to others at different locations around the city. With the growing emphasis on accessibility-based planning, analysts should approach the calculation of accessibility with care and recognize the potential for algorithmic dependence in their calculated accessibility results.},

  abstract = {PurposePrior cancer research is limited by inconsistencies in defining rurality. The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of cancer risk factors and cancer screening behaviors across various county-based rural classification codes, including measures reflecting a continuum, to inform our understanding of cancer disparities according to the extent of rurality.MethodsUsing an ecological cross-sectional design, we examined differences in cancer risk factors and cancer screening behaviors from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and National Health Interview Survey (2008{\textendash}2013) across rural counties and between rural and urban counties using four rural{\textendash}urban classification codes for counties and county-equivalents in 2013: U.S. Office of Management and Budget, National Center for Health Statistics, USDA Economic Research Service's rural{\textendash}urban continuum codes, and Urban Influence Codes.ResultsAlthough a rural-to-urban gradient was not consistently evident across all classification codes, the prevalence of smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and binge alcohol use increased (all ptrend {$<$} 0.03), while colorectal, cervical and breast cancer screening decreased (all ptrend {$<$} 0.001) with increasing rurality. Differences in the prevalence of risk factors and screening behaviors across rural areas were greater than differences between rural and urban counties for obesity (2.4\% vs. 1.5\%), physical activity (2.9\% vs. 2.5\%), binge alcohol use (3.4\% vs. 0.4\%), cervical cancer screening (6.8\% vs. 4.0\%), and colorectal cancer screening (4.4\% vs. 3.8\%).ConclusionsRural cancer disparities persist across multiple rural{\textendash}urban classification codes, with marked variation in cancer risk factors and screening evident within rural regions. Focusing only on a rural{\textendash}urban dichotomy may not sufficiently capture subpopulations of rural residents at greater risk for cancer and cancer-related mortality.},

  abstract = {This article reflects on the racial configuration of urban space. Previous research tends to posit racial segregation and diversity as either endpoints on a continuum of racial dominance or mirror images of one another. We argue that segregation and diversity must be jointly understood; they are necessarily related, although not inevitably as binary opposites. Our view is that the neighborhood geographies of U.S. metropolitan areas are simultaneously and increasingly marked by both racial segregation and racial diversity. We offer an approach that classifies neighborhoods based jointly on their compositional diversity and their racial dominance, illustrated by an examination of the neighborhood racial structure of several large metropolitan areas for 1990 and 2000. Compositional diversity increased in all metropolitan areas in ways rendered visible by our approach, including a sharp reduction in the number of highly segregated white neighborhoods, transitioning mostly into moderately diverse yet still white-dominated neighborhoods, and a fourfold increase in the number of highly diverse neighborhoods. Even so, many highly segregated spaces remain, especially for whites and blacks. Latino-dominated spaces show a mix of persistence and emergence. Although compositional diversity is increasing, highly diverse neighborhoods are still rare and are the least persistent of all racial configurations. Our approach clearly demonstrates the ?both/and?-ness of segregation and diversity.},

Therefore, territoriality, or territorial control, is its irreducible element.1 As it is traditionally conceived, the exercise of territoriality requires that the territorial extent of control be clearly bounded and communicated. But in settler colonial contexts the frontier is a mobile index of expansion {\textendash} though not yet fully inhabited or annexed, it would eventually and inevitably be part of the settler polity. Therefore, the form of territorial control operating in the frontier of settler colonial formations is unbounded territoriality, a strategy of territorial control best exercised by not delimiting boundaries, by not making clear the extent of sovereign authority. Because settlers are `founders' of political orders who carry their sovereignty with them into the frontier,2 the territorial limits of settler sovereignty are liminal {\textendash} indeterminate, ambiguous, and pending {\textendash} at least until the frontier is closed and final borders are established. Israel, though, has been unable to close the frontier and delimit final territorial borders, which has resulted in the indefinite character of the `occupation' and the continued exercise of unbounded territoriality, particularly in the West Bank.},

We address this gap by developing a conceptual framework on the social pathways of gentrification and introducing a method of systematic social observation using Google Street View to detect visible cues of neighborhood change. We argue that a durable racial hierarchy governs residential selection and, in turn, gentrifying neighborhoods. Integrating census data, police records, prior street-level observations, community surveys, proximity to amenities, and city budget data on capital investments, we find that the pace of gentrification in Chicago from 2007 to 2009 was negatively associated with the concentration of blacks and Latinos in neighborhoods that either showed signs of gentrification or were adjacent and still disinvested in 1995. Racial composition has a threshold effect, however, attenuating gentrification when the share of blacks in a neighborhood is greater than 40 percent. Consistent with theories of neighborhood stigma, we also find that collective perceptions of disorder, which are higher in poor minority neighborhoods, deter gentrification, while observed disorder does not. These results help explain the reproduction of neighborhood racial inequality amid urban transformation. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

In the decades following the 1965 Hart-Celler Act, gentrification has occurred more in cities with high levels of immigration and in neighborhoods with higher levels of immigrants. These relationships, however, vary by the ways in which a city is racially segregated and by the extent to which its immigrant population has been incorporated. Using crime data, surveys, and new gentrification measures, this article compares Chicago, a highly segregated city and predominantly Hispanic immigrant destination, with Seattle, a predominantly white city with high levels of Asian immigration. The findings show that immigration and its correlates have distinct and evolving relationships with neighborhood changes that are embedded in the racial and immigrant histories of each city, and that gentrification perpetuates racial and ethnic inequality in both cities.},

Recent advances in spatial analysis and geographic information systems present new opportunities for researchers to exploit the potential of housing submarkets as constructs that offer a more precise way to examine residential segregation. The article synthesizes literature related to residential segregation and housing submarkets and demonstrates how to delineate housing submarkets using publicly available data. It examines the spatial distribution of housing submarkets and how the socially disadvantaged are represented across housing submarkets in St. Louis, Missouri, and Cincinnati, Ohio, to conclude that St. Louis's housing market is more polarized and racially segregated than Cincinnati's. Spatial analysis of housing submarkets, in conjunction with archival analysis, provides a promising avenue for identifying residential segregation as a multidimensional phenomenon, and a means to explore local processes of urban inequality.},

Most minority respondents, regardless of socioeconomic status and years of residency, defined their neighborhood as a large and inclusive spatial area, using a single name and conventional boundaries, invoking the area's black cultural history, and often directly responding to the alternative way residents defined their neighborhoods. Both long-term and newer white respondents defined their neighborhood as smaller spatial areas and used a variety of names and unconventional boundaries that excluded areas that they perceived to have lower socioeconomic status and more crime. The large and inclusive socially constructed neighborhood was eventually displaced. These findings shed light on how the internal narratives of neighborhood identity and boundaries are meaningfully tied to a broader structure of inequality and shape how neighborhood identities and boundaries change or remain.},

Yet, the studies do not explicitly test whether the concentration of subprime loans in minority neighborhoods varied by segregation levels. We address this shortcoming by integrating neighborhood-level data and spatial measures of segregation to examine the relationship between segregation and subprime lending across the 100 largest US metropolitan areas. Controlling for alternative explanations of the housing crisis, we find that segregation is strongly associated with higher concentrations of subprime loans in clusters of minority census tracts but find no evidence of unequal lending patterns when)},

  abstract = {Although we have been studying gentrification for more than 50 years now, gentrification seems to have become a hot topic of public concern only in recent years. The growing interest in the phenomenon reflects both its increasing prevalence and its changing na-ture. The term now conjures up connotations and stylized images of race and class, but these are often inconsistent with scholarly findings of gentrification. These inconsisten-cies between the past and present and between the public and academic understanding of the phenomenon bring us to an appropriate juncture to reflect on the scholarship on gentrification. For most of the twentieth century, the study of neighborhood change that dominated urban sociology explained neighborhood decline in central cities. With rapid urban growth in the first half of the twentieth century followed by the large-scale decline of manufacturing and suburbanization, the general trend of central city neighborhoods in the United States was indeed decline. It is no surprise, then, that theoretical understand-ings of neighborhood change largely focused on this particular direction of change. Early Chicago School scholars described the invasion and succession process by which the in-nermost central city neighborhoods continually remained home to those with the lowest socioeconomic status as cities grew and new immigrants arrived (Park et al. 1925), and a subsequent generation of urban scholars sought to explain the declining social condi-tions in the poor minority neighborhoods that expanded in the years after World War II (e.g., Massey and Denton 1993; Wilson 1987). Following the publications of Wilson's (1987) The Truly Disadvantaged and Massey and Denton's (1993) American Apartheid, a field of research blossomed, particularly within urban sociology, on the persistence of these poor minority neighborhoods. This research has made substantial progress over the last few decades in advancing our understanding of the causes and consequences of these neighborhoods. While the dominant trend of low-income, central city neighborhoods has cer-tainly been that of decline and persistence, gentrification{\textemdash}the socioeconomic upgrad-ing of previously low-income, central city neighborhoods 1 {\textemdash}has become increasingly widespread and has made its mark in many urban areas by now. Urban scholars began to take note of gentrification appearing across several cities over 50 years ago. Gentri-fication countered the dominant trend of low-income, central city neighborhoods, and forced scholars to rethink understandings of neighborhood change, which mainly ex-plained the decline of central city neighborhoods at the time. a break from suburbanization and homogeneity for many middle-and upper-class res-idents and a restructuring of central business districts and nearby areas. In response, scholars sought to explain the extent of this phenomenon and understand its causes and consequences. Over the years, research on gentrification made considerable progress. As gentrifica-tion took place in more cities and neighborhoods, scholarship on the subject increased and included many notable developments in the field (for comprehensive reviews, see Brown-Saracino 2010; Lees et al. 2008; Zukin 1987). Much of this progress can be at-tributed to scholars uncovering the " chaotic " (Rose 1984) nature of the process. Despite this progress, theoretical and empirical understandings of gentrification have not par-alleled those of studies of neighborhood decline and the persistence of neighborhood poverty and segregation. In an Annual Review of Sociology article on gentrification, Zukin (1987) describes an " empirical stalemate " in the field stemming from disagreement on the underlying struc-ture of gentrification. Since Zukin's (1987) publication, gentrification has taken on new and even more complex forms that vary across cities. Gentrification since the late 1990s reflects a new era of gentrification distinct from its past. Hackworth and Smith (2001) describe this gentrification as more intense and widespread, occurring beyond the cen-tral core of cities in economically riskier areas. Others emphasize the shift in gentrifi-cation's relationship to race (e.g., Goetz, 2011; Hyra, 2012) and the increasing role of state and corporate actors in facilitating contemporary gentrification (e.g., Hackworth, 2007). Despite our improved understanding of gentrification's complexity, the increasing complexity of gentrification itself has left us still in an " empirical stalemate. " As gentrification has become even more chaotic than before, a growing plurality of disciplines beyond sociology and geography, including economics, history, political science, and public health, to name a few, are studying it. Further, gentrification has become increasingly politicized in public discourse, and conceptual and methodologi-cal disagreements continue to plague the field. In the remainder of this essay, I propose approaches to studying gentrification that I believe can move research beyond this empir-ical stalemate. These approaches can help bridge past understandings of gentrification with present ones and can lead to improved empirical research that can inform public understandings and move policy solutions forward. First, studying the process of gentrification in relation to processes of neighborhood stability can advance the study of neighborhood dynamics more broadly. One way in which scholarship on gentrification has been limited is that it has generally remained isolated from the study of persistent poverty and segregation. This isolation of research agendas has limited theoretical progress. When gentrification was a relatively small-scale phenomenon occurring in select major cities and primarily near downtown areas, the separate development of gentrification research may have been sufficient. With gentrifi-cation's increased prevalence and growing public concern surrounding its implications for inequality, it no longer suffices to study gentrification separately from the persistence of poor minority neighborhoods. After all, neighborhoods are interdependent: Why some neighborhoods change{\textemdash} either upward or downward{\textemdash}and others remain the same is a social process in itself that shapes and is shaped by the social conditions of other neighborhoods. For exam-ple, gentrifiers 2 select neighborhoods depending on the ecological context within which they are choosing which neighborhoods to upgrade. In highly segregated cities, where 2},

Analysis of U.S. Census and American Community Survey data over 24 years and field surveys of gentrification in low-income neighbor- hoods across 23 U.S. cities reveal that most gentrifying neighborhoods were ``global'' in the 1970s or became so over time. An early presence of Asians was positively associated with gentrification; and an early presence of Hispanics was positively associated with gentrification in neighborhoods with substantial shares of blacks and negatively associated with gentrification in cities with high Hispanic growth, where ethnic enclaves were more likely to form. Low-income, predominantly black neigh- borhoods and neighborhoods that became Asian and Hispanic destinations remained ungentrified despite the growth of gentrification during the late twentieth century. The findings suggest that the rise of immigration after 1965 brought pioneers to many low- income central-city neighborhoods, spurring gentrification in some neighborhoods and forming ethnic enclaves in others.},

This study investigates the consequences of the back-to-the-city movement through a four-year (2009-2012) ethnographic case study of the revitalisation of Washington, DC's Shaw/U Street neighbourhood. The redevelopment of this African-American neighbourhood is associated with the city's 5.2 percent population increase, which occurred between 2000 and 2010. While affordable housing efforts help to keep a portion of long-term, low-income residents in place, political and cultural displacement is occurring as upper-income newcomers flock into this neighbourhood.

Using data from the 1970 to 2000 decennial censuses and the 2005-2009 American Community Survey (ACS), our analysis indicates that black dissimilarity and isolation declined more in the South and West than in the Northeast and Midwest. Nevertheless, regional population shifts account for only a modest amount (8 \% to 12 \%) of the decline in black-white segregation over the period and for an even smaller proportion of the decline in black-nonblack segregation, in part because the largest declines in segregation occurred in the West while the region with the largest relative increase in the black population was the South. Using more refined census divisions rather than census regions provided some additional explanatory power (shifts across divisions explained 15 \%-16 \% of the decline in black-white segregation): divisions with larger gains in their share of the black population tended to have larger declines in black segregation. Overall, although the effect of the regional redistribution of the black population on declines in segregation was significant, of even greater importance were other causes of substantial declines in segregation in a wide array of metropolitan areas across the country, and especially in the West, over the past 40 years.},

Rather than focus on the residential patterns of specific minority or immigrant groups, this study examines changing patterns of white residential segregation in metropolitan America. Using data from the 1980 to 2010 decennial censuses, we calculate levels of white segregation using two common measures, analyze the effect of defining the white population in different ways, and, drawing upon the group threat theoretical perspective, we examine the metropolitan correlates of white segregation. We find that white segregation from others declined significantly from 1980 to 2010, regardless of the measure of segregation or the white population used. However, we find some evidence consistent with the group threat perspective, as white dissimilarity is higher in metro areas that are more diverse, and especially those with larger black populations. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that whites having been living in increasingly integrated neighborhoods over the last few decades, suggesting some easing of the historical color line.;},

Using data from the 1980 to 2000 decennial census and the 2010 e2014 American Community Survey, we examine the association between concentrated poverty across metropolitan areas in the United States and key proximate factors, including overall changes in poverty, racial residential segregation, and income segregation. One of our unique contributions is assessing the relative contribution of each of these to long-term trends in such poverty using a decomposition analysis. We find that changes in the segregation of the poor explained the largest share of the change in concentrated poverty over most of the time period, with the exception of the 1990s, where the plunge in both black and white poverty rates had the largest role in explaining the considerable decline in concentrated poverty in that decade for both groups. The association between racial segregation and black concentrated poverty is positive but weaker, indicating that without declines in black segregation, concentrated poverty would have been higher. Overall, growing income segregation, along with weak economic performance in recent years, have put more poor people at risk for living in high-poverty communities.},

Over the past several decades, many statistical methods have been proposed to address this ecological inference problem. We propose an alternative method to reduce aggregation bias by predicting individual-level ethnicity from voter registration records. Building on the existing methodological literature, we use Bayes's rule to combine the Census Bureau's Surname List with various information from geocoded voter registration records. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology using approximately nine million voter registration records from Florida, where self-reported ethnicity is available. We find that it is possible to reduce the false positive rate among Black and Latino voters to 6\% and 3\%, respectively, while maintaining the true positive rate above 80\%. Moreover, we use our predictions to estimate turnout by race and find that our estimates yields substantially less amounts of bias and root mean squared error than standard ecological inference estimates. We provide open-source software to implement the proposed methodology.},

  abstract = {Urban scholars and practitioners have used changes in neighborhood-level home values to serve as indicators of neighborhood change, including gentrification and disinvestment. A common measure is the ``median home value'' variable from the American Community Survey (ACS). However, household-level research suggests that self-assessed home values, such as those of the ACS, differ significantly from market-based measures, and medians can be affected by changes in the mix of homes . Transaction-based home price indices are unaffected by such changes and are based on market sales rather than self-assessments, but also have limitations. Moreover, self-assessments of home values might be desired if the intention is to measure the value households place on their homes or to avoid potential biases baked into market values. Comparing changes in the ACS median home value to a common market-based home price index (HPI), we find that the ACS median tends to fall more slowly than the HPI when values are falling and increase more slowly than the HPI when values rise. The differences between the measures are large and are not randomly distributed across space, tending to be larger in neighborhoods where values fall or rise more steeply. They are also related to a variety of neighborhood characteristics.},

Location of grocery stores where individuals shop and its association with BMI were examined. Methods The 2000 U.S. Census data were linked with the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Study (L.A.FANS) database, which consists of 2620 adults sampled from 65 neighborhoods in Los Angeles County between 2000 and 2002. In 2005, multilevel linear regressions were used to estimate the associations between BMI and socioeconomic characteristics of grocery store locations after adjustment for individual-level factors and socioeconomic characteristics of residential neighborhoods. Results Individuals have higher BMI if they reside in disadvantaged areas and in areas where the average person frequents grocery stores located in more disadvantaged neighborhoods. Those who own cars and travel farther to their grocery stores also have higher BMI. When controlling for grocery store census tract socioeconomic status (SES), the association between residential census tract SES and BMI becomes stronger. Conclusions Where people shop for groceries and distance traveled to grocery stores are independently associated with BMI. Exposure to grocery store mediates and suppresses the association of residential neighborhoods with BMI and could explain why previous studies may not have found robust associations between residential neighborhood predictors and BMI.},

Although Hispanics and Asians have always displayed declining levels of minority-white dissimilarity and rising levels of minority-white interaction with rising income, income differentials on these outcomes for blacks did not appear until 1990 and since then have improved at a very slow pace. Given their higher overall levels of segregation and income's limited effect on residential attainment, African Americans experience less integration, more neighborhood poverty at all levels of income compared to other minority groups. The degree of black spatial disadvantage is especially acute in the nation's 21 hypersegregated metropolitan areas.},

The other, designed under the leadership of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), focuses on the integration of urban and rural within metropolitan and micropolitan areas. Forgetting the distinction between separation and integration is dangerous, for example, when (mis)using the OMB system as if it differentiated between urban and rural. At stake is the misunderstanding of rural conditions, the misdirection of federal programs and funds, and a breakdown of communication that confuses people. This article presents two alternatives that can strengthen the foundations of research and policy and uses one of them to analyze rural distress and prosperity. Much can be gained by using these better rural definitions to replicate important research to see whether key findings hold true and to review eligibility requirements and funding procedures to determine whether government programs are reaching the rural people and places they are intended to serve.},

Taking advantage of the hierarchical nature of the data both by industry and geography, the first stage identifies the smallest possible range for each suppressed number. Ensuring that employment adds up correctly up and down the industrial and geographical hierarchies, the second stage iteratively adjusts all the estimates until millions of constraints are met.

  abstract = {The 2010 Census revealed the extent to which today's metropolitan areas are growing increasingly diverse. At the forefront of this change are schools. Yet, research on school context continues to rely upon a traditional, cross-sectional bifurcation that designates schools as either diverse or not. This classification may be especially inaccurate for some educational outcomes such as whether schools are cultivating effective citizenship for a diverse democracy. Because of changing demographics, this paper considers whether a new framework for conceptualizing school racial composition, including the number and identity of specific racial groups and the stability of those groups, can determine more precisely the ways in which school diversity impacts students' citizenship learning.},

It is usually accounted for as the consequence of biased flows of relevant information through local social networks, and no reference is made to the role of political parties in the manipulation of those flows and networks. Such a role was referred to in pioneer geographical studies, but has largely been ignored since, apparently because it does not readily fit into the spatial science paradigm. It is argued that the agenda-setting role of parties and the importance of local organisation are crucial influences on voting patterns. Parties are embedded in local cultures and are involved in their creation. -Author Dept. of Geography, Univ. of Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, UK.},

Using a recently established method of classifying residential areas according to their ethnic composition which facilitates comparative study over time and space, this paper examines segregation trends in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and Miami over the period 1980-2000 in the context of recent discussions of the nature of residential patterns there. It finds that though there has been some reduction in the extent of extreme segregation areas that are predominantly either White or African American with consequent greater ethnic mixing at the census tract level, nevertheless cores of extreme segregation remain, and these are being extended with greater segregation of the Hispanic population. Ethnic residential segregation in United States' metropolitan areas attracted much research throughout the 20th century, with each census providing new impetus for mapping and analysis. The 2000 census will be no exception, providing data with which the extent of change can be assessed after a further decade in which discrimination on the grounds of race and color was illegal. This paper provides an initial exploration for four metropolitan areas that have experienced substantial recent multi-ethnic in-migration. Using a method for classifying residential areas designed to facilitate comparative studies over space and time, it explores the extent of desegregation during the previous 20 years for each of the four main census ethnic groups.},

Disproportionality in the translation of votes into seats (in this case, from popular votes to votes in the Electoral College) is common to contests using a winner-takes-all electoral system. So is bias, whereby that disproportionality does not apply equally to each candidate. Analysis of the bias at those two elections shows that Bush was favoured at the first but not at the second. Identification of the bias components shows that Bush was advantaged by variations in the number of popular votes per Electoral College voter across the states, and also by variation in turnout. In 2000, his popular votes were also more efficiently distributed than Gore's; in 2004 they were less efficiently distributed than Kerry's, largely because of increased turnout - producing larger numbers of surplus votes - in states that were already safe for Bush. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Disproportionality in the translation of votes into seats (in this case, from popular votes to votes in the Electoral College) is common to contests using a winner-takes-all electoral system. So is bias, whereby that disproportionality does not apply equally to each candidate. Analysis of the bias at those two elections shows that Bush was favoured at the first but not at the second. Identification of the bias components shows that Bush was advantaged by variations in the number of popular votes per Electoral College voter across the states, and also by variation in turnout. In 2000, his popular votes were also more efficiently distributed than Gore's; in 2004 they were less efficiently distributed than Kerry's, largely because of increased turnout - producing larger numbers of surplus votes - in states that were already safe for Bush. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It is usually accounted for as the consequence of biased flows of relevant information through local social networks, and no reference is made to the role of political parties in the manipulation of those flows and networks. Such a role was referred to in pioneer geographical studies, but has largely been ignored since, apparently because it does not readily fit into the spatial science paradigm. It is argued that the agenda-setting role of parties and the importance of local organisation are crucial influences on voting patterns. Parties are embedded in local cultures and are involved in their creation. -Author Dept. of Geography, Univ. of Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, UK.},

Its judgement in a 2006 case indicated that although the Court recognised the practice, it could identify no formal means of evaluating whether any particular map of Congressional or State electoral districts was a gerrymander that violated a constitutional provision. This encouraged those who drew up new district maps in many states after publication of the 2010 census data, most of which favoured the Republican party and were more egregious than previous such cartographies. A minority judgement in that case did suggest ways in which a gerrymander could be proved, however, and these were followed in a case brought regarding new State Assembly districts for Wisconsin. A lower court found in favour of the plaintiffs but this was over-turned by a unanimous Supreme Court which found that the plaintiffs had no standing to challenge a state-wide map. A concurrent decision by a minority of the Justices did suggest ways in which standing could be established and gerrymanders countered, and this may stimulate further cases{\textemdash}although it is uncertain whether a majority on the Court will accept such arguments.

In this article, we examine the characteristics of adults' "activity spaces"-spaces defined by locations that individuals visit regularly-in Los Angeles County, California. Using geographic information system (GIS) methods, we define activity spaces in two ways and estimate their socioeconomic characteristics. Our research has two goals. First, we determine whether residential neighborhoods represent the social conditions to which adults are exposed in the course of their regular activities. Second, we evaluate whether particular groups are exposed to a broader or narrower range of social contexts in the course of their daily activities. We find that activity spaces are substantially more heterogeneous in terms of key social characteristics, compared to residential neighborhoods. However, the characteristics of both home neighborhoods and activity spaces are closely associated with individual characteristics. Our results suggest that most people experience substantial segregation across the range of spaces in their daily lives, not just at home.},

We highlight the contradiction between the goals of these partnerships in international agricultural development, which seek to shift power dynamics and counter market exclusion, and the internal logic of these hybrid governance approaches, which reflect the tensions of market society from which they come. We present case studies from Honduras, Peru, and Mali of agricultural public-private and public-philanthropic partnerships and their constituent actors, identifying roles and relationships among actors that personify double movement negotiations within pro-poor market-oriented development. The cases highlight the implications for civil society actors of hybrid governance systems that utilize market mechanisms to address the destructive tendencies of capitalist development. We conclude that partnerships characterized by a mismatch of responsibilities and power relations among civil society and private actors generate a new type of double movement that does not generate durable institutions and that limits the impacts of the partnerships for poor farmers.},

While the demographic components of natural increase and migration have received the overwhelming share of attention to date, this paper addresses the effects of administrative reclassification on urban population growth as derived from census data, which remain largely unstudied. We adopt a spatial approach, using the finest resolution US census data available for three decennial census periods, to estimate the magnitude of reclassification and examine the spatial-temporal variation in reclassification effects. We supplement the census data by using satellite-derived settlement data to further explain reclassification outcomes. We find that while 10\% and 7\% of the population live in areas that underwent urban/rural reclassification during the 1990{\textendash}2000 and 2000{\textendash}2010 time periods, respectively (with smaller fractions of corresponding land), reclassification has a substantial effect on metrics derived to characterize the urbanization process{\textemdash}comprising roughly 44\% and 34\% of total urban population growth over each period. The estimated magnitude of this effect is sensitive to assumptions regarding the timing of reclassification. The approach also reveals where, how, to what degree, and, in some part, why reclassification is affecting to the process of urbanization on the fine spatial scale, including the impact of underlying demographic processes. This research provides new directions to more effectively study coupled nature{\textendash}human systems and their interactions.},

While proponents argue that neighborhood governance can improve efficacy and responsiveness of urban governance, critics warn that socioeconomic bias privileges the parochial interests of higher-income residents. There is limited knowledge, however, concerning the specific types of activities community-representing organizations undertake. This study illuminates the community mediation process through an analysis of the agenda orientation of community-representing organizations. An analysis of actual meeting agendas from Los Angeles neighborhood councils demonstrates that these community-representing organizations engage with varied issues including community improvement and other types of service needs or preferences in addition to land use. The findings suggest a more complex relationship between income and agenda orientation than is generally acknowledged. In particular, lower-income communities focus heavily on internal maintenance and capacity development activities that may displace engagement with more substantive issues. In contrast to the conventional wisdom that these organizations are likely to channel middle-class NIMBYism, the analysis reveals a U-shaped relationship between income and land-use emphasis, evidence that engagement in land use is also emphasized in lower-income communities that historically have been the target of locally undesirable land uses.},

Detecting spatial autocorrelation patterns of health indicators on ACS data can be distorted to the point that scholars may have difficulty in perceiving the true pattern. We examine the statistical properties of spatial autocorrelation statistics of areal incidence rates based on ACS data.

What's more, 30\% of all Americans could live in California, Texas, and Florida (U.S. Census Bureau, 2005). Regardless of whether such high levels of continued Sunbelt migration occur or other patterns emerge, population movement will have electoral implications as the composition of migration streams change the balance of party identifiers at both origins and destinations. To illustrate how migration streams can exhibit very different levels of 'political effectiveness,' this research substantively addresses three key issues under-examined in the current literature: 1) the ability of migration to both reinforce and dilute party strength, 2) the changes in partisanship at the origin and destination of migration streams effected through processes analogous to 'packing' and 'cracking' in electoral redistricting literature, and 3) the importance of migration selectivity. This research uses an innovative, albeit far-from-precision method to suggest how recent U.S. migration trends may portend changes in Republican and Democratic partisanship. Using 2000 Presidential election exit polls by state, along with 1995-2000 PUMS migration data, individual party identification is inferred from individual migrant characteristics. This research calls attention to and argues for research to address the highly complex relationships of migration with electoral geographies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Aging and lacking infrastructure are major impediments to economic development in rural America. To address these issues, civic leaders often look to state and federal infrastructure grant/loan funding, where eligibility is often based on income requirements established by the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS). The problem, especially for rural communities, is that ACS data contain a high degree of statistical uncertainty (i.e., margin of error) that is often disregarded for determining program eligibility. For rural communities with unreliable income estimates, the most common work-around involves hiring a consultant to conduct an income census or survey to formally challenge the US Census Bureau's ACS estimate. Many rural communities, however, elect not to formally challenge unreliable ACS estimates either because they are unaware that reimbursement for conducting an income survey is an allowable expense under some grant/loan programs or they are dissuaded by the necessary time and resources. First, I summarize whether federal infrastructure grant/loan programs incorporate MOE values when determining community eligibility. Second, I examine the degree to which ACS estimates are statistically reliable for communities across rural America. Finally, using an example from Oregon, I recommend guidelines for how states can assist rural communities with statistically unreliable ACS estimates. These findings can help rural communities secure infrastructure funding that advances economic development and quality of life, and potentially support reliable data-driven policy and decision-making more broadly.},

This study takes advantage of increasingly available land parcel and business establishment data to analyze how the measurement of proximity to urban services or amenities performed in many fields can be impacted by using these data-which can be considered "individual" when compared to aggregated origins or destinations. We use business establishment data across five distinctive US cities: Long Beach, Irvine, and Moreno Valley in California; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and the New York borough of Staten Island. In these case studies, we show how aggregation error, a previously recognized concern in using census-type data, can be minimized through careful choice of distance measures. Informed by these regions, we provide recommendations for researchers evaluating the potential risks of a measurement strategy that differs from the "gold standard" of network distance from individually measured, point-based origins and destinations. We find limited support for previous hypotheses regarding measurement error based on the abundance or clustering of urban services or amenities, though further research is merited. Importantly, these new data sources reveal vast differences across cities, underscoring how accurate proximity measurement necessitates a critical understanding of the nuances of the urban landscape under investigation as measures appear heavily influenced by a city's street layouts and historical development trajectories.},

Our quantitative analyses of program impacts at the Boston site of MTO uses data on 540 families approximately two years after program enrollment. 48 percent of the Experimental group and 62 percent of the Section 8 Comparison group moved through the MTO program. Households in both treatment groups experienced improvements in multiple measures of well-being relative to the Control group including increased safety, improved health among household heads, and fewer behavior problems among boys. There were no significant short-run impacts of either MTO treatment on employment, earnings, or welfare receipt. Experimental group children were less likely to be personally victimized by crime, to be injured, or to experience an asthma attack.},

  abstract = {The present article aims at assessing the possibility for urban areas to coordinate local policies of urban development and public transportation and at explaining the differences in this achievement between urban regions. In order to do so, the study draws support from two empirical sources: a historical analysis of the ``mass-production'' generated by the public service sectors in the field of transport and urban development in the cities of Basel, Bern, Geneva, and Lausanne since 1950, and a series of six case studies in these four cities. The study identifies factors located both at context level regarding morphological and geographical conditions as well as institutional settings and case-specific idiosyncrasies regarding organizational structure, past policy decisions, as well as vocational cultures that determine the possibility for urban areas to meet the need for policy coordination.}

  abstract = {Gentrification is generally associated with improvements in neighborhood amenities, but we know little about whether the improvements extend to public schools. Using administrative data (from spring 1993 to spring 2004) from the third largest school district in the United States, we examine the relationships between gentrification and school{\textendash}level student math and reading achievement, and whether changes in the composition of the student body account for any changes in achievement. After testing several alternative specifications of gentrification, we find that, in Chicago, gentrification has little effect on neighborhood public schools. Neighborhood public schools experience essentially no aggregate academic benefit from the socioeconomic changes occurring around them. Furthermore, they may even experience marginal harm, as the neighborhood skews toward higher income residents. For the individual student, starting first grade in a school located in a gentrifying neighborhood has no association with the relative growth rate of their test scores over their elementary school years.           ,              Los Efectos de la Gentrificaci{\'o}n en Escuelas P{\'u}blicas Locales (Micere Keels, Julia Burdick{\textendash}Will y Sara Keene)                            Resumen               La gentrificaci{\'o}n est{\'a} generalmente asociada a mejoras en los servicios locales. Sin embargo, sabemos poco sobre si estas mejoras se extienden a las escuelas p{\'u}blicas. Usando informaci{\'o}n administrativa (desde el verano del 1993 a la primavera del 2004) del tercer distrito escolar m{\'a}s grande los EE.UU. examinamos la relaci{\'o}n entre gentrificaci{\'o}n y rendimiento a nivel escuela en matem{\'a}ticas y lectura, y si los cambios en la composici{\'o}n del alumnado tienen efectos en dicho rendimiento escolar. Luego de probar varias alternativas, encontramos que, en Chicago, la gentrificaci{\'o}n tiene poco efecto en las escuelas p{\'u}blicas locales. Las escuelas p{\'u}blicas locales no experimentan en general alg{\'u}n beneficio acad{\'e}mico agregado de los cambios socioecon{\'o}micos que ocurren alrededor de ellas. Es m{\'a}s, estas incluso pueden experimentar un da{\~n}o marginal en la medida que el espacio local es colmado de residentes de mayores ingresos. Para el estudiante, empezar el primer grado en una escuela ubicada en un barrio en gentrificaci{\'o}n no guarda alguna relaci{\'o}n con la mejora en sus pruebas escolares a lo largo de sus a{\~n}os de educaci{\'o}n primaria.},

We conduct the first independent evaluation of bias and noise induced by the Bureau's two main disclosure avoidance systems: the TopDown algorithm employed for the 2020 Census and the swapping algorithm implemented for the 1990, 2000, and 2010 Censuses. Our evaluation leverages the recent release of the Noisy Measure File (NMF) as well as the availability of two independent runs of the TopDown algorithm applied to the 2010 decennial Census. We find that the NMF contains too much noise to be directly useful alone, especially for Hispanic and multiracial populations. TopDown's post-processing dramatically reduces the NMF noise and produces similarly accurate data to swapping in terms of bias and noise. These patterns hold across census geographies with varying population sizes and racial diversity. While the estimated errors for both TopDown and swapping are generally no larger than other sources of Census error, they can be relatively substantial for geographies with small total populations.},

This paper adds to the growing body of literature in search of a more nuanced definition of rural by applying unsupervised machine learning (ML) to the abundance of existing county-level data in the United States. The authors illustrate how this method can lead to a new county typology, named after economic development strategies, that accounts for idiosyncrasies in resources, opportunities, and challenges. This research serves as a practical step toward tractable, heterogeneous classifications that can inform the work of federal, state, and local policy makers, economic development practitioners, and many others.},

While the resulting enumerations are regularly cited by critical human geographers, the wider political stakes of indexing the world remain unaddressed. In this article, we theorise indexification as the process through which composite statistics transform theoretical constructs into epistemic objects, and then geographically bounded rankings. Rather than a neutral process, we argue that these epistemological manoeuvres can mask various forms of violence. Through a detailed analysis of the UK's Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), we highlight the clandestine politics of indexification and their tendency to conceal harms meted out by the state. Seeking a more critical reckoning with indices, we conclude by calling for and outlining a project of radical indexification{\textemdash}a participatory, democratic, and transparent endeavour that takes spatial justice as its organising principle.},

In the course of reviewing subsequent research that has made progress in addressing these challenges, we identify both potential limits and possibilities for the SWT thesis. We argue for the importance of identifying how actors' agency{\textemdash}i.e., the way people use their ties{\textemdash}may affect social networks' value. We conclude by summarizing some outstanding questions that progress on the SWT thesis has generated. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Sociology, Volume 49 is July 2023.

  abstract = {This book provides a solution to the ecological inference problem, which has plagued users of statistical methods for over 75 years: How can researchers reliably infer individual-level behavior from aggregate (ecological) data? In political science, this question arises when individual-level surveys are unavailable (for instance, local or comparative electoral politics), unreliable (racial politics), insufficient (political geography), or infeasible (political history). This ecological inference problem also confronts researchers in numerous areas of major significance in public policy, and other academic disciplines, ranging from epidemiology and marketing to sociology and quantitative history. Although many have attempted to make such cross-level inferences, scholars agree that all existing methods yield very inaccurate conclusions about the world. In this volume, Gary King lays out a unique - and reliable - solution to this venerable problem. pt. I. Introduction. 1. Qualitative Overview. 2. Formal Statement of the Problem -- pt. II.

  abstract = {"Geographic polarization", the spatial concentration of "like" voting behavior, is a phenomenon closely related to "partisan polarization", the intensification of diametrically ideological positions, is understudied, and is critical to the understanding of current American electoral behavior. To date, few studies have examined geographic polarization, and those that do have done so at the scales of regions, states, and counties. However, local influences operating within areas smaller than counties influence voting behavior and can produce geographic polarization. To address these scalar and methodological shortcomings, this research focuses on the smallest political units, precincts, using a case study of the Greater Cincinnati Metropolitan Area. Presidential election data from 1976 through 2008 were collected by precincts, analyzed using spatial statistics, and mapped to examine evolving geographic polarization over this 32-year period. The results measured at the precinct-scale, suggest an increased concentration of partisan behavior and emphasize a local residential spatial pattern of geographic polarization.},

The first part examines this dichotomy between public and private space and finds it to be more apparent than real, insofar as it is difficult to claim a sharp conceptual distinction between the two; moreover, the social benefits of public space are shown to be overdrawn, while those of private space are shown to be commonly overlooked. Having begun to dismantle the dichotomy, the second part of the paper discusses the public-private spaces in a rapidly growing metropolitan area in the Southwestern US and explores their implications for social relations. Given that these newer spaces are less different than is sometimes claimed, it is not surprising that they display some familiar forms of social interaction. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We use a survey of Swedish-born young adults in Stockholm, whose parents were born either in Turkey (Stratum T) or in Sweden (Stratum S). Stratum T was randomly sampled, whereas Stratum S was sampled according to the residential distribution of Stratum T. Our results show that persons in Stratum T use informal contacts in order to find employment more often than Stratum S. Living in immigrant-dense areas increases the likelihood of finding employment through informal contacts. For Stratum T, co-ethnic contacts are more important than other contacts, in particular if they are neighbours. Access to ethnic networks and the use of ethnic contacts in the labour market differ between persons of Turkish, Kurdish and Assyrian/Syriac backgrounds. In contrast to the isolation thesis, this study shows that young adults in immigrant-dense neighbourhoods have access to and b...},

A test file of 70 addresses, 50 of which involved errors, was generated, and the file was geocoded to the census tract and block group levels by 4 commercial geocoding firms. Also, the ``real world'' accuracy of the best-performing firm was evaluated. Results. Accuracy rates in regard to geocoding of the test file ranged from 44\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 32\%, 56\%) to 84\% (95\% CI = 73\%, 92\%). The geocoding firm identified as having the best accuracy rate correctly geocoded 96\% of the addresses obtained from the public health databases. Conclusions. Public health studies involving geocoded databases should evaluate and report on methods used to verify accuracy. (Am J Public Health. 2001;91:1114-1116)},

Multilevel models based on data from the National Neighborhood Crime Study for 7,622 neighborhoods in 79 cities throughout the United States reveal that segregation is positively associated with violent crime for white and various types of nonwhite neighborhoods. Nonetheless, there is a lack of parity in violence across these types of communities reflecting the larger racialized social system in which whites are able to use their privileged position to reside in the most advantaged neighborhoods, while African-Americans and Latinos live in the most disadvantaged urban communities and therefore bear the brunt of urban criminal violence.},

A graph-theoretical approach is used to create many meaningful delineations for labour market regions in Germany and the modularity concept from network analysis is employed to select the delineation that captures the commuting flows best. As a result, a delineation of 50 German labour market regions that are quite heterogeneous in terms of size is obtained. Using the modularity measure, the current delineation is compared with previous functional delineations.},

However, the reason for this tendency is not apparent. This paper suggests that the correlation between segregation and metropolitan scale is spurious. Segregation measures based on census data will tend to rank larger cities higher because larger cities have more neighbourhoods that are big enough to 'fill up' entire census tracts, while smaller cities with equally homogeneous, but smaller, neighbourhoods have to pair neighbourhoods to fill up a census tract. This bias will be reduced at smaller levels of spatial aggregation. This prediction is tested by comparing segregation measures computed at several levels of spatial aggregation and with American Housing Survey data. The results suggest that spatial aggregation effects are important: the correlation between city size and measured segregation appears to be at least partly spurious.},

Are these neighborhood preferences color-blind or race conscious? Does neighborhood racial composition have a net influence upon preferences, or is race a proxy for social class? This article tests the racial proxy hypothesis using an innovative experiment that isolates the net effects of race and social class, followed by an analysis of the social psychological factors associated with residential preferences. The authors find that net of social class, the race of a neighborhood's residents significantly influenced how it was rated. Whites said the all-white neighborhoods were most desirable. The independent effect of racial composition was smaller among blacks, who identified the racially mixed neighborhood as most desirable. Further, whites who held negative stereotypes about African-Americans and the neighborhoods where they live were significantly influenced by neighborhood racial composition. None of the proposed social psychological factors conditioned African-Americans' sensitivity to neighborhood racial composition.},

This paper examines whether or not geographic sorting has occurred and why it has occurred using a novel, dynamic analysis. Our findings indicate that geographic sorting is on the rise, but that it is a very recent phenomenon. In the 1970s and 1980s, counties tended to become more competitive, but by 1996 a pattern of partisan sorting had emerged and continued through the present. Results suggest this pattern is driven by Southern re-alignment and voting behavior in partisan stronghold counties. Lastly, we find evidence that migration can drive partisan sorting, but only accounts for a small portion of the change.},

To date, social scientists have largely ignored this question, in part because their focus has not been on local politics and elections. We think this is unfortunate given that 99\% of all governments in the U.S. are local governments. Given stark differences in rates of turnout and office seeking across local and state/federal elections, we believe more attention to the way in which `sense of place' affects residents' political behavior is warranted. In this study we look explicitly at how the geographic, functional, and socio-demographic features of cities shape turnout and contestation in local elections. Analyzing mayoral elections in two U.S. states, we find evidence not only that contextual factors are associated with both turnout and contestation, but place itself matters, independently of the features of its inhabitants, for the health of local democracy.},

This article aims to advance research methods for rural researchers by offering guidelines for navigating high levels of error associated with the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS presents a useful source of U.S. community level data for rural researchers to utilize in school{\textendash}community research but not without its difficulties. The small population sizes of rural communities often translate to large margins of error in the data, presenting a degree of uncertainty in the actual measure. To illustrate challenges and best practice, the author conducts a case study of the relationship between the presence of schools and economic vitality of rural communities in Indiana using ACS data. The author demonstrates how to examine the error in the data, introduces options to reduce uncertainty, and ultimately, explains how to move forward with the data, working with the margin of error and acknowledging its presence in the analysis and results. This article offers suggestions and techniques to assist rural researchers in navigating ACS obstacles so that they might produce transparent results with as little uncertainty as possible.},

We pursue a new tract-free approach that combines explicitly spatial concepts and methods to examine racial segregation across egocentric local environments of varying size. Using 2000 Census data for the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, we compute a spatially modified version of the information theory index H to describe patterns of Black-White, Hispanic-White, Asian-White, and multigroup segregation at different scales. We identify the metropolitan structural characteristics that best distinguish micro-segregation from macro-segregation for each group combination, and we decompose their effects into portions due to racial variation occurring over short and long distances. A comparison of our results with those from tract-based analyses confirms the value of the new approach.},

A Bayesian hierarchical approach is typically used to produce such maps, which represents the risk surface with a set of random effects that exhibit a single global level of spatial smoothness. However, in complex urban settings, the risk surface is likely to exhibit localized rather than global spatial structure, including areas where the risk varies smoothly over space, as well as boundaries separating populations that are geographically adjacent but have very different risk profiles. Therefore, this paper proposes an approach for capturing localized spatial structure, including the identification of such risk boundaries. The effectiveness of the approach is tested by simulation, before being applied to lung cancer incidence data in Greater Glasgow, UK, between 2001 and 2005.},

Recent research based on large-scale quantitative data suggests that the displacement effects of gentrification for low-income residents evident from case studies and qualitative data are modest at the macroscale. We use geocoded microdata from the American Community Survey to investigate the association between gentrification and residential mobility in the 2010s, the time period following the Great Recession. Our large national sample allows us to consider heterogeneity in the association between gentrification and residential mobility, investigating differential association by distinct clusters of metropolitan areas. We find a modest positive significant association between moderate and intense gentrification and residential mobility in our full national sample. The national estimates, however, mask considerable heterogeneity in the association between gentrification and residential mobility in different types of metropolitan areas. College Town and Retirement Destination metros see the largest positive association between gentrification and residential mobility, while Large Coastal and Large Southern/Midwestern metros experience a more modest positive association. We find weak or no significant association in Inland Empire/Texas Border metros. We heed a call for more investigation of heterogeneity in neighborhood processes across different contexts.},

This article proposes the contested boundaries hypothesis as a refined contextual explanation focused on poorly defined boundaries between ethnic and racial groups. The authors argue that neighborhood conflict is more likely to occur at fuzzy boundaries defined as interstitial or transitional areas sandwiched between two homogeneous communities. Edge detection algorithms from computer vision and image processing allow them to identify these boundaries. Data from 4.7 million time- and geo-coded 311 service requests from New York City support their argument: complaints about neighbors making noise, drinking in public, or blocking the driveway are more frequent at fuzzy boundaries rather than crisp, polarized borders. By focusing on the broader sociospatial structure, the contested boundaries hypothesis overcomes the ``aspatial'' treatment of neighborhoods as isolated areas in research on ethnic diversity.},

  abstract = {The 1990s have witnessed growing controversy over the issues of minority districting and representation. These controversies have revolved around competing conceptions of the community of interest standard in redistricting. One conception, the transcendent community of interest, suggests that minority groups, in and of themselves, represent a community of interest that transcends space as a result of the group's shared history, culture and legacy of discrimination and segregation. A second view, the traditional geographic community of interest, defines the concept as a formal and/or functional region which can cut across racial and ethnic group divisions. In the early 1990s, the US Department of Justice displayed the transcendent community of interest concept in maximizing majority-minority districts across the South. In the mid-1990s, however, the US Supreme Court and Federal District Courts in invalidating some of these districts have strongly enunciated the traditional geographic conception. This article examines these issues and their potential impact on minority districting and representation by examining the case of Georgia, subject of the US Supreme Court's June 1995 decision in Miller v. Johnson which declared Georgia's 11th congressional district unconstitutional. The last part of the article considers the future impact of this decision by examining how Georgia's congressional districts were redrawn by a Federal District Court in December 1995 based on the concept of traditional, geographic community of interest districts. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, it is unclear whether early-life experiences of segregation shape later-life neighborhood outcomes, whether this association persists for those who migrate out of the metropolitan areas in which they grew up, and how these relationships differ for blacks and whites. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics from 1979 to 2013, we find that the level of segregation experienced during adolescence is associated with significantly worse neighborhood outcomes in adulthood for blacks. However, migrating out of the metropolitan area an individual grew up in substantially moderates these relationships. In contrast, adolescent segregation is associated with improved, or not significantly different, neighborhood outcomes in adulthood for whites. These findings have important implications for theorizing about the mechanisms linking segregation and neighborhood outcomes and for considering potential means of assuaging racial disparities in harmful neighborhood exposures.},

But in its beginnings neoclassical economics was not built from choice theory, did not represent decisions as solutions to constrained optimization problems, made no strong assumptions about the rationality of agents, and did not view the world as always in equilibrium. Agent-based economics can tap into this older neoclassical economics of adaptive behavior and ongoing market processes while circumventing the technical obstacles which forced the forerunners to adopt the ``static'' method. Agent-based process analysis will finally make it possible to tackle the central problem of macroeconomics, namely, the self-regulating capabilities of a capitalistic economy. Keynes challenged the presumption that flexibility of all prices guaranteed the stability of general equilibrium, arguing that effective demand failures meant that Say's Law did not hold. When supply did not create its own demand, stabilization policy in the form of aggregate demand management was required to restore full employment. In modern general equilibrium based macroeconomics, in contrast, Say's Law always holds, only ``frictions'' stand in the way of full employment, and stabilization policy lacks any tenable rationalization. Agent-based computational methods provide the only way in which the self-regulatory capabilities of complex dynamic models can be explored so as to advance our understanding of the adaptive dynamics of actual economies.},

This paper seeks to move the focus on to the question of how best to model sub-markets once they have been identified. It focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of multilevel models as a technique for modelling sub-markets. The paper uses data on housing transactions from Perth, Western Australia, to develop and compare three competing sub-market modelling strategies. Model 1 consists of a city-wide  benchmark'; model 2 provides a series of sub-market-specific hedonic estimates (this is the  industry standard') and models 3 and 4 provide two variants on the multilevel model (differentiated by variation in the degrees of spatial granularity embedded in the model structure). The results suggest that the more granular multilevel specification enhances empirical performance and reduces the incidence of non-random spatial errors.},

In this regard, two strong discourses emerge: that of economic development and community. What are the synergies, antagonisms, or other relationships between these two frameworks? Do policy actors reconcile the differing discourses by appealing to a metanarrative, engaging in a pluralistic or agonistic process, or finding compromise solutions? Are there differing narratives within each of these broad frameworks? This article examines the divergences and convergences of these two discourses.

  abstract = {As communities evolve greater capacities for mobilisation and political action, local issues are finding new entry-points into development and land use planning. In this regard, two strong discourses emerge: that of economic development and community. What are the synergies, antagonisms, or other relationships between these two frameworks? Do policy actors reconcile the differing discourses by appealing to a metanarrative, engaging in a pluralistic or agonistic process, or finding compromise solutions? Are there differing narratives within each of these broad frameworks? This article examines the divergences and convergences of these two discourses.

  abstract = {During this decade the United States Supreme Court has made significant rulings on constitutional challenges to representative districts purposefully drawn to empower minorities as district majorities. Arguments have set the Voting Rights Act against the Fourteenth Amendment's goal of a colorblind society. The court has generally struck down the aggressive drawing of majority-minority districts, finding them racial classifications not narrowly tailored to achieve compelling state interests. This study analyzes and evaluates these legal developments, principally through a focus upon the most recent litigation in Georgia. My thesis - that the Court has muddled the jurisprudence of representation, voting rights and racial equality because of its inability to treat politics and geography with consistency, depth, rigor and judgement - will be explored in connection with five questions. First, can compact and regular shape provide the courts with a concept to properly assess the legal issues without involving the courts in intractable and injudicious political questions? Second, does a bizarrely shaped district 'broadcast' such an invidious racial message as to constitute a 'stigmatic harm' which provides plaintiffs with standing to challenge the district? Third, is a district's bizarre shape critical evidence of the districters' intent to discriminate? Fourth, is 'community of interest' a significantly richer criterion than shape for evaluating racial gerrymandering claims and defenses? Fifth, what is the proper legal role of traditional criteria of territorial representation as the benchmarks for distinguishing permissible from impermissible race-conscious districting?

We also perform a sensitivity analysis. The sample-free method better fits the reference distributions of both individuals and households. It is also less data demanding but it requires more pre-processing. The quality of the results for the sample-based method is highly dependent on the quality of the initial sample.},

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Income segregation has risen in each of the last four decades in U.S. metropolitan areas, which can have lifelong impacts on the health, economic productivity, and behaviors of residents. Although it is widely assumed that local land use regulations{\textemdash}such as minimum lot sizes and growth controls{\textemdash}exclude low-income households from wealthier neighborhoods, the empirical research is surprisingly limited. We examine the relationship between land use regulation and segregation by income using new measures for the 95 biggest cities in the United States. We find that density restrictions are associated with the segregation of the wealthy and middle income, but not the poor. We also find that more local pressure to regulate land use is linked to higher rates of income segregation, but that more state control is connected to lower-income segregation.Takeaway for practice: Density restrictions do drive urban income segregation of the rich, not the poor, but should be addressed because rich enclaves create significant metropolitan problems. Planners at the local level need assistance from regional and state efforts to ameliorate income segregation. Inclusionary housing requirements have a greater potential to reduce income segregation than bringing higher-income households into lower-income parts of the city. Finally, comprehensive and consistent data on the impacts of local land use regulations should be collected to inform future research and planning practice.},

The procedure models probable allocations for each single household to one of the small area units as derived from bootstrap analysis. The method allows evaluation of the uncertainty of the allocation dependent on the constraint variables used for the imputation of population weights which is based on empirical likelihood methods. Dasymetric mapping is demonstrated as an effective tool to spatially refine the allocation of households and shows great potential for more advanced spatial allocation processes.},

  abstract = {Human settlement plays a key role in understanding social processes such as urbanization and interactions between human and environmental systems but not much is known about the landscape evolution before the era of operational remote sensing technology. In this study, housing and property databases are used to create new gridded settlement layers describing human settlement processes at fine spatial and temporal resolution in the conterminous United States between 1810 and 2015. The main products are a raster composite layer representing the year of first settlement, and a raster time series of built-up intensity representing the sum of building areas in a pixel. Several accompanying uncertainty surfaces are provided to ensure the user is informed about inherent spatial, temporal and thematic uncertainty in the data. A validation study using high quality reference data confirms high levels of accuracy of the resulting data products. These settlement data will be of great interest in disciplines in which the long-term evolution of human settlement represents crucial information to explore novel research questions.},

We compare and combine data series of officially-designated urban areas, 1990{\textendash}2010, at the census block-level within Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) with a satellite-derived consistent series on built-up area from the Global Human Settlement Layer to create urban classes that characterize urban structure and provide estimates of land and population. We find considerable heterogeneity in urban form across MSAs, even among those of similar population size, indicating the inherent difficulties in urban definitions. Over time, we observe slightly declining population densities and increasing land and population in areas captured only by census definitions or low built-up densities, constrained by the geography of place. Nevertheless, deriving urban proxies from satellite-derived built-up areas is promising for future efforts to create spatio-temporally consistent measures for urban land to guide urban demographic change analysis.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Population data represent an essential component in studies focusing on human{\textendash}nature interrelationships, disaster risk assessment and environmental health. Several recent efforts have produced global- and continental-extent gridded population data which are becoming increasingly popular among various research communities. However, these data products, which are of very different characteristics and based on different modeling assumptions, have never been systematically reviewed and compared, which may impede their appropriate use. This article fills this gap and presents, compares and discusses a set of large-scale (global and continental) gridded datasets representing population counts or densities. It focuses on data properties, methodological approaches and relative quality aspects that are important to fully understand the characteristics of the data with regard to the intended uses. Written by the data producers and members of the user community, through the lens of the ``fitness for use'' concept, the aim of this paper is to provide potential data users with the knowledge base needed to make informed decisions about the appropriateness of the data products available in relation to the target application and for critical analysis.},

This study examines the impact of residential segregation on the welfare of populations in US metropolitan areas using economic growth as the indicator. Panel data of US metropolitan areas spanning 25 years, 1980-2005, are used to analyse the effect of segregation on economic growth. The results show that both racial and skill segregation have a negative impact on short- and long-term economic growth, which have increased over time. Further, the negative impact of the variables associated with spatial mismatch is also revealed. The results clearly point to the need for mobility policies that favour non-White households and comprehensive strategies that promote economic opportunities in low-resource communities in the US.},

  abstract = {Spatial pattern analysis plays an important role in geography for understanding geographical phenomena, identifying causes, and predicting future trends. Traditional pattern analysis tools assess cluster or dispersed patterns of geographical features based on the distribution of nonspatial attributes. These metrics ignore the shape of spatial objects-a critical consideration. The study of shape analysis, on the other hand, measures the compactness, elongation, or convexity of an areal feature based merely on geometry, without considering patterns of its attribute distribution. This article reports our efforts in developing a new pattern analysis method called the normalized mass moment of inertia (NMMI) that integrates both shape and nonspatial attributes into the analysis of compactness patterns. The NMMI is based on a well-known concept in physics-the mass moment of inertia-and is capable of detecting the degree of concentration or diffusion of some continuous attribute on an areal feature. We termed this the mass compactness. This measure can be reduced to a shape compactness measure when the attribute is evenly distributed on the feature. We first describe the theoretical model of the NMMI and its computation and then demonstrate its good performance through a series of experiments. We further discuss potentially broad applications of this approach in the contexts of urban expansion and political districting. In the political districting context, higher NMMI of a congressional district suggests a lower degree of gerrymander and vice versa. This work makes an original and unique contribution to spatial pattern and shape analysis by introducing this new, effective, and efficient measure of mass compactness that accounts for both geometric and spatial distribution.},

Roughly 30 percent of America's poor reside in poor places, and concentrated poverty is especially high among poor African Americans. Overall increases in place-based poverty nonetheless were muted over the decade by declines in concentrated poverty among poor Hispanics (a pattern that reflects spatial diffusion to new destinations).

Whether Hispanics have joined the American mainstream depends in part on whether they translate upward mobility into residence patterns that mirror the rest of the nation. Based on block and place data from the 1990-2010 decennial censuses, our results provide evidence of increasing spatial assimilation among Hispanics, both nationally and in new immigrant destinations. Segregation from whites declined across the urban size-of-place hierarchy and in new destinations. Hispanics are also less segregated from whites than from blacks, but declines in Hispanic-black segregation have exceeded declines in Hispanic-white segregation. This result is consistent with the notion of U.S. Hispanics as a racialized population--one in which members sometimes lack the freedom to join whites in better communities. Hispanic income was significantly associated with less segregation from whites, but income inequality alone does not explain overall Hispanic segregation, which remains high. The segmented assimilation of Hispanics that we observe supports two seemingly contradictory theories: both the idea that spatial assimilation can come from economic and cultural assimilation and the notion that economic mobility is no guarantee of residential integration.},

Our objective is to highlight both the conceptual limitations of the so-called rural{\textendash}urban divide, while also recognising the spatial interdependence of America's `rural' and `urban' people and places. Our analyses nest rural and urban population and places within metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties, while acknowledging that rural places often grow into urban places (i.e., urbanisation) and that many non-metropolitan counties are reclassified over time as metropolitan areas (i.e., metropolitanisation). Analyses show that most rural people{\textemdash}as officially defined{\textemdash}now live in metropolitan counties, often at the fringe. Reclassification to metropolitan areas was a major reason why. Small towns and thinly settled areas at the metropolitan fringe have grown rapidly since 1980 and have become increasingly integrated within metropolitan areas nationally. The heuristic value of our analytical approach at the national level is further demonstrated at the local-area level, in Chicago and Atlanta, metro areas with very different demographic and economic histories. Our study highlights the dynamic and multidimensional nature of spatial boundaries (i.e., urban{\textendash}rural and metro{\textendash}nonmetro) that both separate and connect rural and urban areas in the United States.

Motivated by the rich but inconclusive literature on the consequences of educational and residential segregation, we make use of a natural policy experiment--a judicial decision to end court-ordered busing--to estimate the causal impacts of this policy shift on household residential decisions. We find that, for those who moved, the legal decision made White families with children in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools substantially more likely than they were during desegregation to move to a neighborhood with a greater proportion of White residents than their own neighborhood.},

Our simulations showed that both IPR and IDR are effective to account for heterogeneous population sizes. The tests based on IPR and IDR are applied to a set of log-rate models for early-stage and late-stage breast cancer with socioeconomic and access-to-care data in Kentucky. The results showed that socioeconomic and access-to-care variables can sufficiently explain spatial clustering of early-stage breast carcinomas, but these factors cannot explain that for the late stage. For this reason, we used local spatial association terms and located four late-stage breast cancer clusters that could not be explained. The results also confirmed our expectation that a high screening level would be associated with a high incidence rate of early-stage disease, which in turn would reduce late-stage incidence rates.},

  abstract = {Political redistricting, a well-known problem in political science and geographic information science, can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem, with objectives and constraints defined to meet legal requirements. The formulated optimization problem is NP-hard. We develop a scalable evolutionary computational approach utilizing massively parallel high performance computing for political redistricting optimization and analysis at fine levels of granularity. Our computational approach is based in strong substantive knowledge and deep adherence to Supreme Court mandates. Since the spatial configuration plays a critical role in the effectiveness and numerical efficiency of redistricting algorithms, we have designed spatial evolutionary algorithm (EA) operators that incorporate spatial characteristics and effectively search the solution space. Our parallelization of the algorithm further harnesses massive parallel computing power provided by supercomputers via the coupling of EA search processes and a highly scalable message passing model that maximizes the overlapping of computing and communication at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate desirable effectiveness and scalability of our approach (up to 131K processors) for solving large redistricting problems, which enables substantive research into the relationship between democratic ideals and phenomena such as partisan gerrymandering.},

  abstract = {A direct focus on social class has largely disappeared from questions concerning spatial divisions. Instead, studies on residential segregation usually focus on ethnicity, education or income; seemingly the common perception is that people are now divided by such factors and that class divisions belong to the past. Although the structures of inequality have changed in recent times, little is known about how they affect spatial divisions. Here, we investigate these issues by analysing the developments of class segregation in Norway's capital, Oslo, during a period of great societal change and welfare state expansion. We analyse both vertical segregation, between the upper class and the working class, and horizontal segregation, between class factions possessing a high level of mainly cultural or economic capital. We apply a Bourdieu-inspired classification scheme to capture data on the parents of full cohorts of children aged 13{\textendash}15 years in 1970, 1980 and 2003. The results support the idea of a changed class structure, with segregation levels between the upper and working classes having increased during this period. Moreover, there are also moderate and slightly increasing levels of horizontal segregation between top class factions based on cultural and economic capital.},

These areas are generally understood in terms of an "immigrant enclave" model in which ethnic neighborhoods in central cities serve relatively impoverished new arrivals as a potential base for eventual spatial assimilation with the white majority. This model, and the "ethnic community" model, are evaluated here. In the ethnic community model, segregated settlement can result from group preferences even when spatial assimilation is otherwise feasible. Analysis of the residential patterns of the largest immigrant groups in New York and Los Angeles shows that most ethnic neighborhoods can be interpreted as immigrant enclaves. In some cases, however, living in ethnic neighborhoods is unrelated to economic constraints, indicating a positive preference for such areas. Suburban residence does not necessarily imply living outside of ethnic neighborhoods. Indeed, for several groups the suburban enclave provides an alternative to assimilation-it is an ethnic community in a relatively high-status setting.},

This article takes advantage of recently available data on black and white residential patterns in several major northern cities in the period 1880-1940. Using geographic areas smaller than contemporary census tracts, we trace the growth of black populations in each city and trends in the level of isolation and segregation. In addition we analyze the determinants of location: which blacks lived in neighborhoods with higher black concentrations, and what does this tell us about the ghettoization process? We find that the development of ghettos in an embryonic form was well underway in 1880, that segregation became intense prior to the Great Migration, and that in this whole period blacks were segregated based on race rather than class or southern origin.},

Census tract data in the United States are a prime example, since there are substantial shifts in tract boundaries from decade to decade. This study compares alternative estimates of the 2000 population living within 2010 tract boundaries to the Census Bureau's own re-tabulation. All methods of estimation are subject to error; this is the first study to directly quantify the error in alternative interpolation methods for U.S. census tracts. A simple areal weighting method closely approximates the estimates provided by one standard source (the Neighborhood Change Data Base or NCDB), with some improvement provided by considering only area not covered by water. More information is used by the Longitudinal Tract Data Base (LTDB), which relies on a combination of areal and population interpolation as well as ancillary data about water-covered areas. Another set of estimates provided by NHGIS uses data about land cover in 2001 and the current road network and distribution of population and housing units at the block level. Areal weighting alone results in a large error in a substantial share of tracts that were divided in complex ways. The LTDB and NHGIS perform much better in all situations, but are subject to some error when boundaries of both tracts and their component blocks are redrawn. Users of harmonized tract data should be watchful for potential problems in either of these data sources.},

Urban historians have pointed out ways in which the Southern postbellum pattern was less benign, but studies relying on census data aggregated by administrative areas - and segregation measures based on this data {\textendash} have not confirmed their observations. Methods: This study is based mainly on 100\% microdata from the 1880 census that has been mapped at the address level in Washington, D.C. This data makes it possible to examine in detail the unique spatial configuration of segregation that is found in this city, especially the pattern of housing in alleys. Results: While segregation appears to have been low, as reflected in data by wards and even by much smaller enumeration districts, analyses at a finer spatial scale reveal strongly patterned separation between blacks and whites at this early time. Contribution: This research provides much new information about segregation in a major Southern city at the end of the 19th century. It also demonstrates the importance of dealing explicitly with issues of both scale and spatial pattern in studies of segregation.},

  abstract = {Abstract   Social scientists routinely rely on methods of interpolation to adjust available data to their research needs. Spatial data from different sources often are based on different geographies that need to be reconciled, and some boundaries (e.g., administrative or political boundaries) change frequently. This study calls attention to the potential for substantial error in efforts to harmonize data to constant boundaries using standard approaches to areal and population interpolation. The case in point is census tract boundaries in the United States, which are redefined before every decennial census. Research on neighborhood effects and neighborhood change rely heavily on estimates of local area characteristics for a consistent area of time, for which they now routinely use estimates based on interpolation offered by sources such as the Neighborhood Change Data Base (NCDB) and Longitudinal Tract Data Base (LTDB). We identify a fundamental problem with how these estimates are created, and we reveal an alarming level of error in estimates of population characteristics in 2000 within 2010 boundaries. We do this by comparing estimates from one of these sources (the LTDB) to true values calculated by re-aggregating original 2000 census microdata to 2010 tract areas. We then demonstrate an alternative approach that allows the re-aggregated values to be publicly disclosed, using ``differential privacy'' (DP) methods to inject random noise that meets Census Bureau standards for protecting confidentiality of the raw data. We show that the DP estimates are considerably more accurate than the LTDB estimates based on interpolation, and we examine conditions under which interpolation is more susceptible to error. This study reveals cause for greater caution in the use of interpolated estimates from any source. Until and unless DP estimates can be publicly disclosed for a wide range of variables and years, research on neighborhood change should routinely examine data for signs of estimation error that may be substantial in a large share of tracts that experienced complex boundary changes.},

  abstract = {A longstanding debate asks why African Americans have been disproportionately concentrated in poor neighborhoods. All sides agree that a key contributor is the high level of poverty among Blacks, but they differ on other sources. Has the exodus of a growing Black middle class from the inner city (raising income segregation among Blacks) left the Black poor more isolated? Does persistent high racial segregation hold both middle class and poor Blacks in neighborhoods that are depressed by the high rate of Black poverty? Is poverty in Black neighborhoods mainly due to the presence of poor Black households or poor non-Black neighbors? This study addresses these questions with data for 1980{\textendash}2020, and extends the analysis also to the case of Hispanic poverty exposure. Longitudinal models and detailed analysis of neighborhood composition by race and income show that the group's own income composition is the most important predictor of poverty exposure. This effect is compounded by high racial segregation. Within-group income segregation adds to poverty concentration for Blacks but not for Hispanics. Blacks and Hispanics of all income levels live in poorer neighborhoods mainly because of the large share of their Black and Hispanic low-income neighbors, while their white neighbors tend to have higher incomes than they do.},

Although available data includes quantified indicators of uncertainty in aggregated location-specific estimates for a range of variables, this uncertainty is often ignored, the consequences of which may include estimate bias and reduced statistical power. Fortunately, the measurement error literature provides a range of useful tools for handling such error. We propose and demonstrate a new application of existing, well-supported measurement error models to spatial regression models. We show that the existing solution of ignoring the measurement error inherent in these data precludes precise effect estimation and that straightforward modifications to traditional estimators can be made to correct for this error. We intend for this work to establish the basic principles of error correction in spatial data and a new method for applying corrected regression estimators to such data.},

Though studies argue it influences how communities are represented through constituency service, they are limited since legislators' service activities are unobserved. Using Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, we collected 88,000 records of communication between members of the U.S. Congress and federal agencies during the 108th?113th Congresses. These legislative interventions allow us to examine members' ?follow-through? with policy implementation. We find that women, racial/ethnic minorities, and veterans are more likely to work on behalf of constituents with whom they share identities. Including veterans offers leverage in understanding the role of political cleavages and shared experiences. Our findings suggest that shared experiences operate as a critical mechanism for representation, that a lack of political consensus is not necessary for substantive representation, and that the causal relationships identified by experimental work have observable implications in the daily work of~Congress.},

Substantive and methodological errors explain why they arrived at their findings. Specifically, their analysis ignores the effect of the presence of Latinos on the election of African Americans. Ironically, due to the very policy assessed in the article, Cameron, Epstein, and O'Halloran's data set does not allow them to examine the link between the racial composition of a district and the ideology of its representative.

Nevertheless, the theoretical frameworks we have for describing residential settlement patterns generally treat diversity as an unstable and transitory period that is the product of a unidirectional pressure towards segregation. In our analysis of six diverse neighborhoods in Southeast Seattle, we find evidence of processes at multiple scales that not only maintain diversity, but actually reinforce it. From individual decisions about property ownership to broader patterns of regional disinvestment, we find empirical evidence that indicates a need for a more complex theorization of the processes that create and sustain diverse neighborhoods. In our preliminary theorization of these conditions, we call for a conceptualization of residential settlement patterns that is explicitly multiscalar and recognizes a wider range of cultural, economic, and political relations as central to the production of observed patterns of neighborhood settlement.},

Recent theoretical literature shows that central regions with large clusters of economic activity are able to set positive tax rates without fear of losing firms to peripheral regions as the firms would forego  rents' from agglomeration economies. We study whether local policy makers effectively tax such agglomeration rents. We test this with data from Swiss municipalities. We find that municipalities in large urban areas indeed set higher tax rates than those in small ones. Within urban areas, however, municipal tax rates are unrelated to the size of economic activity in and around municipalities while they are positively related to the size of the political jurisdiction. We see this result as evidence that the standard tax competition model for asymmetric jurisdictions is at work in the competition of municipalities within an urban area.},

The first nationwide data for places of 65,000 or more was released in the summer of 2006. It has several interesting implications for planning. On the one hand, more current data will eliminate many of the inaccuracies introduced by projection-based updates of stale census data. On the other, smaller sample sizes will mean we will have less precise estimates. Because the ACS will use averaged rather than point-in-time data, it will measure slightly different things than the decennial census. Finally, planners should be alert to the opportunities they will have to improve local data quality by improving the address file from which the sample is drawn.},

In order to assess the spatial dimension of multi-party elections, we propose an empirical procedure combining three existing approaches: a separation method (Grofman et al. 1997), a multi-party estimation method (King 1990), and Monte Carlo simulations of national elections (Linzer, 2012). We apply the proposed method to the study of recent national lower chamber elections in Mexico. Analysis uncovers systematic turnout-based bias in favor of the former hegemonic ruling party that has been offset by district geography substantively helping one or both other major parties.},

The three types of agents{\textemdash}consumer, farmer and developer{\textemdash}all make decisions based on underlying economic principles, and heterogeneity of both individuals and the landscape is represented. CHALMS simulates the conversion of farmland to housing development over time, through the actions of the agents in the land and housing markets. Land and building structures in the housing bundle are treated explicitly, so the model can represent the effects of land and housing prices on housing density over time. We use CHALMS to simulate the dynamics of land-use changes as a representative suburban area grows. The presence of agent and landscape heterogeneity, stochastic processes, and path dependence require multiple model runs, and the expression of spatial dispersion of housing types, overall housing density, and land prices over time in terms of the most likely, or `average', patterns. We find that CHALMS captures both the general tendency for diminishing population density at greater distances from the center city, and dispersed leapfrog patterns of development evident in most suburban areas of the US.},

  abstract = {This article contributes both to the expanding literature on the effect of school choice and to the literature focusing on how to measure and conceptualize neighborhood effects. It uses a novel approach to the measurement of geographical context to analyze neighborhood influences on school choice attitudes among Swedish parents. Data on attitudes come from a survey of 3,749 families with children in upper primary school. Geographical context is measured using multi-scalar contextual factors based on socioeconomic indicators for individually defined, bespoke neighborhoods that incorporate from 12 to 12,800 people. The results show that parental motives for choosing schools in Sweden are strongly influenced by the social and ethnic composition of their own and their adjacent neighborhoods. Contrary to most other studies, we find effects of socioeconomic context stronger than the effects of the parents' own social and ethnic background. Thus, parents living in academic, high-income areas put little stress on attending an assigned school, close-to-home schools, or stating that the municipality has influenced their decision. Furthermore, these attitudes become even stronger if nearby neighborhoods are dominated by visible minorities and disadvantaged groups. Supported by Sampson's ideas of coordinated perceptions among inhabitants in the same neighborhoods, we explain these surprisingly strong contextual effects with the idea that school choice motives are especially sensitive to neighbors' ideas and easily influenced as measured preferences in a survey.},

In this paper I show that neoliberalism in ocean fisheries has a specific form and history based on the ways that, for the last 50 years, regulation debates have centered on the question of the commons. Focus on the role of the commons in problems such as overfishing and overcapacity has contributed to convergence of different viewpoints around neoliberal, market-oriented approaches that try to harness the profit motive to conservation and economic efficiency. I trace the idea of property rights in fisheries from the point in the 1950s when economists first identified the commons as the underlying cause of fisheries problems, through extended political jurisdiction, to recent emphasis on the benefits of common property. Despite their differences, proponents of these different viewpoints all take property as their central problematic and contribute to the idea that creating market incentives, by specifying property rights, is the foundation upon which proper use of ocean resources rests. I illustrate these ideas with a description of the shift toward privatization in the fisheries of the US portion of the North Pacific, which have a direct annual value of almost \$1 billion. Neoliberal approaches to fisheries regulation are not simply spillover from larger trends toward market-based governance, but instead are influenced by the ways that past policy orientations toward fisheries have centered on enclosing the oceans within carefully delimited regimes of property rights, be those regimes of collective, state, or private control. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we describe new efforts to fundamentally change the landscape of population-environment data by integrating, preserving, and disseminating vast amounts of aggregate census and agricultural census data. We are developing data manipulation tools and workflow management approaches to transform and standardize data as well as capture metadata. These developments in turn facilitate the processing, documenting, and intake of tens of thousands of data tables into IPUMS Terra, which then are shared with the scientific community and the broader public to advance understanding of the population and agricultural systems that are central to many complex human-environment systems.},

A review of their conceptual foundations and evidence on their effectiveness shows that projects that rely on community participation have not been particularly effective at targeting the poor. There is some evidence that such projects create effective community infrastructure, but not a single study establishes a causal relationship between any outcome and participatory elements of a community-based development project. Most such projects are dominated by elites, and both targeting and project quality tend to be markedly worse in more unequal communities. A distinction between potentially "benevolent" forms of elite domination and more pernicious types of capture is likely to be importantfor understanding project dynamics and outcomes. Several qualitative studies indicate that the sustainability of community-based initiatives depends crucially on an enabling institutional environment, which requires government commitment, and on accountability of leaders to their community to avoid "supply-driven demand-driven" development. External agents strongly influence project success, but facilitators are often poorly trained, particularly in rapidly scaled-up programs. The naive application of complex contextual concepts like participation, social capital, and empowerment is endemic among project implementers and contributes to poor design and implementation.

The most commonly used subcounty geographical unit for social research in the United States is the census tract. However, the changing geometries and historically incomplete coverage of tracts present significant obstacles for longitudinal analysis that existing datasets do not sufficiently address. Overcoming these barriers, we provide housing unit estimates in consistent 2010 tract boundaries for every census year from 1940 to 2010 plus 2019 for the entire continental US. Moreover, we develop an ``urbanization year'' indicator that denotes if and when tracts became ``urbanized'' during this timeframe. We produce these data by blending existing interpolation techniques with a novel procedure we call ``maximum reabsorption.'' Conducting out-of-sample validation, we find that our hybrid approach generally produces more reliable estimates than existing alternatives. The final dataset, Historical Housing Unit and Urbanization Database 2010 (HHUUD10), has myriad potential uses for research involving housing, population, and land-use change, as well as (sub)urbanization.},

The arts' regional economic contribution is generally measured by totalling the revenue of larger arts organisations, associated expenditures by patrons and multiplier effects.

The methodology provides a means for packaging university intellectual property in ways that align with core competencies of corporations and is designed to maintain consistency with the mission, ethics, and organizational practices of both large corporations and research universities. For historical and organizational reasons, intellectual property at universities tends to be developed in discrete units that are, in turn, licensed as discrete units-usually based on a patent. The authors call this model one-off licensing. Although widely practiced, one-off licensing may diminish the university's ability to realize the full potential of its intellectual property. Enhanced value results when several pieces of related intellectual property are grouped together. Synergistic groupings of intellectual property also enhance the ability of universities to spin out successful contributions to business formation.},

Our aim in this paper, therefore, is, first, to highlight some of the unresolved issues that surround these concepts, and, second, to explore their usefulness for understanding the evolution of the economic landscape and the process of regional development. We argue that in many important aspects, path dependence and `lock-in' are placedependent processes, and as such require geographical explanation. However, the precise meaning of regional `lock-in', we contend, is unclear, and little is known about why it is that some regional economies become locked into development paths that lose dynamism, whilst other regional economies seem able to avoid this danger and in effect are able to `reinvent' themselves through successive new paths or phases of development. The issue of regional path creation is thus equally important, but has been rarely discussed. We conclude that whilst path dependence is an important feature of the economic landscape, the concept requires further elaboration if it is to function as a core notion in an evolutionary economic geography.},

However, this measure changes in complex ways contingent on the starting levels of diversity in a place and on the ethnoracial composition of that place. Careful examination of the behavior of Entropy indicates an uneven relationship between compositional shifts in population and shifts in Entropy. We note differences based on the majority population and a tendency for high diversity locations to become less diverse over time. Moreover, adjacent places tend to move together towards greater or lesser diversity with both metropolitan and sub-metropolitan processes leading to correlations in diversity change across decades. Using place level data from the 1990 and 2010 decennial Censuses we quantify these patterns of change and association with the goal of increasing knowledge of baseline conditions so that Entropy can be used with greater nuance in the future.},

  abstract = {Prior research has estimated structural equation models of Hispanic and black spatial assimilation using census tract data in selected cities. While these models appeared to provide an unambiguous picture of ethnic and racial segregation in cities, their estimation from ecological data posed several conceptual and statistical difficulties. This paper replicates the earlier analyses using individual-level data from the 1970 Census. Prior findings were reconfirmed, thereby validating the theory of spatial assimilation and reinforcing earlier substantive conclusions. Results also indicate that, to the extent that ecological biases affect the pattern of results, errors of substantive interpretation are conservative in nature. Thus, models estimated using census tract data for 1980 (when appropriate micro information will not be available) are not likely to yield erroneous conclusions. A},

  abstract = {This paper investigates some of the consequences of black residential segregation using specially compiled data for Philadelphia in 1980. Blacks, like whites, at- tempt to improve their neighborhood characteristics with rising social status, but unlike whites, they face strong barriers to residential mobility. As a result, high status blacks must live in neighborhoods with fewer resources and amenities than whites of similar background. Specifically, they live in poorer, more dilapidated areas characterized by higher rates of poverty, dependency, crime, and mortality, and they must send their children to public schools populated by low income stu- dents who score badly on standardized tests. These findings suggest that racial segregation remains an important basis for stratification in U.S. society. In December of 1985, four hundred whites stood in the streets of south- west Philadelphia shouting racial epithets and protesting the movement of a black family into the working class neighborhood. The newspaper head- lines provided the city and the nation with a shocking reminder of the constraints that blacks still face in choosing where to live (Cass 1986). However, at the same time, blacks and whites across town lived together peacefully in many other areas, including some of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods, where the regular entry and exit of black families elicited no comment at all. This paper explores this apparent paradox and explains why some blacks are allowed to assimilate spatially, while others are not. Using specially prepared data from Philadelphia, we document the detri- mental consequences of racial segregation for blacks in American society.},

Yet these models limit our understanding of what we can know about a city. A City Is Not a Computer reveals how cities encompass myriad forms of local and indigenous intelligences and knowledge institutions, arguing that these resources are a vital supplement and corrective to increasingly prevalent algorithmic models. Shannon Mattern begins by examining the ethical and ontological implications of urban technologies and computational models, discussing how they shape and in many cases profoundly limit our engagement with cities. She looks at the methods and underlying assumptions of data-driven urbanism, and demonstrates how the ``city-as-computer'' metaphor, which undergirds much of today's urban policy and design, reduces place-based knowledge to information processing. Mattern then imagines how we might sustain institutions and infrastructures that constitute more diverse, open, inclusive urban forms. She shows how the public library functions as a steward of urban intelligence, and describes the scales of upkeep needed to sustain a city's many moving parts, from spinning hard drives to bridge repairs. Incorporating insights from urban studies, data science, and media and information studies, A City Is Not a Computer offers a visionary new approach to urban planning and design.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Demography is an inherently spatial science, yet the application of spatial data and methods to demographic research has tended to lag that of other disciplines. In recent years, there has been a surge in interest in adding a spatial perspective to demography. This sharp rise in interest has been driven in part by rapid advances in geospatial data, new technologies, and methods of analysis. OBJECTIVES We offer a brief introduction to four of the advanced spatial analytic methods: spatial econometrics, geographically weighted regression, multilevel modeling, and spatial pattern analysis. We look at both the methods used and the insights that can be gained by applying a spatial perspective to demographic processes and outcomes. To help illustrate these substantive insights, we introduce six papers that are included in a Special Collection on Spatial Demography. We close with some predictions for the future, as we anticipate that spatial thinking and the use of geospatial data, technology, and analytical methods will change how many demographers address important demographic research questions. CONCLUSION Many important demographic questions can be studied and framed using spatial approaches. This will become even more evident as changes in the volume, source, and form of available demographic data-much of it geocoded-further alter the data landscape, and ultimately the conceptual models and analytical methods used by demographers. This overview provides a brief introduction to a rapidly changing field. {\textcopyright} 2013 Stephen A. Matthews \& Daniel M. Parker.},

  abstract = {Exposure science has developed rapidly and there is an increasing call for greater precision in the measurement of individual exposures across space and time. Social science interest in an individual's environmental exposure, broadly conceived, has arguably been quite limited conceptually and methodologically. Indeed, in social science, we appear to lag behind our exposure science colleagues in our theories, data, and methods. In this article, we discuss a framework based on the concept of spatial polygamy to demonstrate the need to collect new forms of data on human spatial behavior and contextual exposures across time and space. Adopting new data and methods will be essential if one wants to better understand social inequality in terms of exposure to health risks and access to health resources. We discuss the opportunities and challenges focusing on the potential seemingly offered by focusing on human mobility and, specifically, the utilization of activity space concepts and data. A goal of the article is to spatialize social and health science concepts and research practice vis-{\`a}-vis the complexity of exposure. The article concludes with some recommendations for future research, focusing on theoretical and conceptual development promoting research on new types of places and human movement, the dynamic nature of contexts, and training.},

  abstract = {Random sampling of graph partitions under constraints has become a popular tool for evaluating legislative redistricting plans. Analysts detect partisan gerrymandering by comparing a proposed redistricting plan with an ensemble of sampled alternative plans. For successful application, sampling methods must scale to maps with a moderate or large number of districts, incorporate realistic legal constraints, and accurately and efficiently sample from a selected target distribution. Unfortunately, most existing methods struggle in at least one of these areas. We present a new Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that generates a sample of redistricting plans converging to a realistic target distribution. Because it draws many plans in parallel, the SMC algorithm can efficiently explore the relevant space of redistricting plans better than the existing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that generate plans sequentially. Our algorithm can simultaneously incorporate several constraints commonly imposed in real-world redistricting problems, including equal population, compactness, and preservation of administrative boundaries. We validate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm by using a small map where all redistricting plans can be enumerated. We then apply the SMC algorithm to evaluate the partisan implications of several maps submitted by relevant parties in a recent high-profile redistricting case in the state of Pennsylvania. We find that the proposed algorithm converges faster and with fewer samples than a comparable MCMC algorithm. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methodology.},

First, we show that congressional polarization is primarily a function of the differences in how Democrats and Republicans represent the same districts rather than a function of which districts each party represents or the distribution of constituency preferences. Second, we conduct simulations to gauge the level of polarization under various ``neutral'' districting procedures. We find that the actual levels of polarization are not much higher than those produced by the simulations. We do find that gerrymandering has increased the Republican seat share in the House; however, this increase is not an important source of polarization.},

  abstract = {Using new data on roll-call voting of US state legislators and public opinion in their districts, we explain how ideological polarization of voters within districts can lead to legislative polarization. In so-called ``moderate'' districts that switch hands between parties, legislative behavior is shaped by the fact that voters are often quite heterogeneous: the ideological distance between Democrats and Republicans within these districts is often greater than the distance between liberal cities and conservative rural areas. We root this intuition in a formal model that associates intradistrict ideological heterogeneity with uncertainty about the ideological location of the median voter. We then demonstrate that among districts with similar median voter ideologies, the difference in legislative behavior between Democratic and Republican state legislators is greater in more ideologically heterogeneous districts. Our findings suggest that accounting for the subtleties of political geography can help explain the coexistence of polarized legislators and a mass public that appears to contain many moderates.},

This article presents case studies of politics and student assignment policy in three large school districts: Boston, Massachusetts; Wake County (Raleigh), North Carolina; and Jefferson County (Louisville), Kentucky. In all three districts, there has been pressure to change student- assignment policies in ways that respond to the priorities of White and middle-class populations, with the potential to worsen the options available to students of color. Our case studies reinforce the criticisms of race-neutral politics and policy that have been made by Eduardo Bonilla-Silva and others. Race-neutral politics during fiscal retrenchment tends to reframe privilege as common sense and to obscure some students' structural disadvantages.},

We investigate whether ethnic as well as other dimensions of neighborhood-level diversity are associated with collective efficacy. Survey data are used to capture perceptions of neighborhood cooperation and social cohesion for 26 344 survey respondents in southeast Pennsylvania; US Census data are used to capture neighborhood concentrated disadvantage and residential mobility, as well as diversity along a range of dimensions, including ethnicity, birthplace, household type, occupation, income, and educational attainment. Multilevel modeling is employed to test the association of various dimensions of neighborhood diversity with individual-level perceptions of neighborhood cooperation and social cohesion, while controlling for individual and other neighborhood-level variables. Results suggest that low collective efficacy is associated with diversity in cultural characteristics such as ethnicity, birthplace, and household type. We ascribe these findings to patterns of neighborhood transition, or churning, where high rates of neighborhood in-migration and out-migration act to weaken collective efficacy. Diversity, both in educational attainment and in income, however, are associated with high neighborhood collective efficacy, and are not related to neighborhood churning.

It lays out two positions{\textemdash}moderate and extreme{\textemdash}and explains that, rather than taking one side or the other, the book tells the story of how these positions emerged in tandem between the 1920s and the 1970s. It contends that population growth has been unfairly blamed for many of the world's problems, and promises to explain how this happened and who has benefited from it. The introduction describes how               Building the Population Bomb               contributes to the history of the social sciences, furthers our understanding of the role of the United States in promoting global development in the second half of the twentieth century, and advances the contemporary project of reproductive justice.},

  abstract = {Recently published social science research suggests that students attending schools with concentrations of disadvantaged racial minority populations achieve less academic progress than their otherwise comparable counterparts in more racially balanced or integrated schools, but to date no meta-analysis has estimated the effect size of school racial composition on mathematics outcomes. This metaregression analysis reviewed the social science literature published in the past 20 years on the relationship between mathematics outcomes and the racial composition of the K-12 schools students attend. The authors employed a two-level hierarchical linear model to analyze the 25 primary studies with 98 regression effects. Results indicate that school racial isolation has a small statistically significant negative effect on overall building-level mathematics outcomes. This relationship is moderated by the size of the sample in the study and by the way the independent variable was operationalized. Although it is small, the effect size is substantively meaningful. The effects are stronger in secondary compared to elementary grades, and racial gaps widen as students age. The emergence and widening of the race gaps as students move through the grades suggest that the association of racial segregation with mathematics performance compounds over time. Implications for educational policy and future research are discussed.},

By emphasizing the free rider problem--why a rational, self-interested individual would engage in collective action when his/her impact is negligible and the benefits of collective action are public and free--rational choice theory correctly problematized collective action. Its reliance on essentialist homo economicus model ofhuman nature, however, often leads to untenale solutions that do not consider nonstrategic forms of rationality, collective identity formation, and the curcial effects of place-specific social relations. Habermas's The Theory of Communicative Action, in contrast, provides a broader conception of rationality that recognizes communicative as well as strategic and instrumental forms of rationality and focuses on social interaction rather than on isolated individuals. Individuals reach common understandings, form communal bonds, and construct collective identities through communicative action. The relative importance of communicative versus strategic forms of action coordination varies geographically and historically and cannot be understood apart from systemic processes. As communicative forms of coordination (based on communicative rationality) are "colonized" by systemic forms of action coordination (based on strategic and instrumental rationality) and destabilizedby cappital hypermobility, communal bonds break down. PLaces become less signiicant as bases for community and more significant in corporate location and investment decisions. These processes, however, engender resistance. Strong place-based communities mobilize when threatened and new forms of collective identity arise through channels created by time-space compression.},

Although a large body of research has focused on how residential mobility patterns produce segregation, little is known about how changing mobility patterns translate into temporal and scale variations in sorting. This article develops a methodological framework designed to explore how changing mobility patterns reflect such trends. It introduces a measure of sorting that reflects the extent of disparities among groups in their socio-spatial mobility. Trends in the direction and the extent of sorting can be exposed by computing sorting measures over consecutive periods. The measure is broken down to capture the relative contributions of residential mobility to sorting at hierarchically nested geographical units, for example cities and their constituent neighbourhoods. An empirical demonstration shows that changes in residential mobility patterns affect the magnitude and spatial level of residenti...},

  abstract = {Despite a dozen studies, the welfare effects of payday credit are still debatable. We contribute new evidence to the debate by studying how payday credit access affects bank overdrafts (such as returned checks), bankruptcy, and household complaints against lenders and debt collectors. We find some evidence that Ch. 13 bankruptcy rates decrease after payday credit bans, but where we find that, we also find that complaints against lenders and debt collectors increase. The welfare implications of these offsetting movements are unclear. Our most robust finding is that returned check numbers and overdraft fee income at banks increase after payday credit bans. Bouncing a check may cost more than a payday loan, so this finding suggests that payday credit access helps households avoid costlier alternatives. While our findings obviously do not settle the welfare debate over payday lending, we hope they resolve it to some extent it by illuminating how households rearrange their financial affairs when payday loan supply changes.},

In this paper, we evaluate the validity and consistency of this conventional wisdom, using both the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections results by county. While previous research has underscored the overall pattern and its accuracy, we choose instead to explore mainly the anomalous results: "metropolitan" or "modern" areas that President Bush carried, and "nonmetropolitan" and "traditional" areas that Democrats won. We develop a typology of the anomalous counties and carry out a simple analysis of characteristics that help show how and why they are anomalous. We then compare the 2000 and 2004 results to discover anomalous areas, counties which switched parties or which became more or less partisan. Trends between 2000 and 2004 suggest a weakening of the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan dimension but a deepening of the cultural one, although we note as well that most of the electorate does not place itself at these partisan extremes. We relate these findings to longer term structural changes in American society, and to Republican strategies to mobilize insecure voters. Finally, we lay out an agenda to look at a sample of counties, using qualitative methods, in order to understand these anomalous results. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Although racial segregation has been declining in recent years, it remains extremely high{\textemdash}especially in the largest metropolitan areas. The historical pattern has been that as African Americans move into a neighborhood, whites move out and thus the neighborhood (gradually or rapidly) transitions from predominantly white to predominantly black. A seemingly contradictory pattern has recently been observed: integrated neighborhoods are becoming more common. Why do some neighborhoods transition from white to black and others become integrated? We use racial competition theory to answer this question. We examine the characteristics of stable, integrated neighborhoods and contrast them with segregated predominantly white, predominantly black, and rapidly transitioning neighborhoods in six large metropolitan areas. We find that the location of black neighborhoods is a key factor in whether an integrated neighborhood remains integrated. Specifically, we find integrated neighborhoods are spatially distant from majority black neighborhoods while transitioning neighborhoods are adjacent to them. Our findings support the ``sense of threat'' hypothesis of racial competition theory.},

Three key aspects of the strategy present significant challenges and need additional policy attention. First is a possibility of unresolved differences inherent in the Alliance's approach. Second, the city focus does not address metropolitan and regional coordination. And third is a lack of robust research to support some of the implementation initiatives. The Alliance's strategies and challenges are similar to the approaches and limitations of international development planning, and this paper is thus also an assessment of conventional practices in development planning.

  abstract = {Opioid misuse is a public health crisis in the United States. The origin of this crisis is associated with a sharp increase in opioid analgesic prescribing. We used the urban scaling framework to analyze opioid prescribing patterns in US commuting zones (CZs), i.e., groups of counties based on commuting patterns. The urban scaling framework postulates that a set of scaling relations can be used to predict health outcomes and behaviors in cities. We used data from the Drug Enforcement Administration's Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) to calculate counts of oxycodone/hydrocodone pills distributed to 607 CZs in the continental US from 2006 to 2014. We estimated the scaling coefficient of opioid pill counts by regressing log(pills) on log(population) using a piecewise linear spline with a single knot at 82,363. Our results show that CZs with populations below the knot scaled superlinearly ({$\beta$} = 1.36), i.e., larger CZs had disproportionally larger pill counts compared to smaller CZs. On the other hand, CZs with populations above the knot scaled sublinearly ({$\beta$} = 0.92), i.e., larger CZs had disproportionally smaller pill counts compared to smaller CZs. This dual scaling pattern was consistent across US census regions. For CZs with population below the knot, the superlinear scaling of pills is consistent with the explanation that an increased number of successful matches between prescribers and users will lead to higher prescribing rates. The non-linear scaling behavior observed could be the result of a combination of factors, including stronger health care systems and prescribing regulation in largely populated commuting zones, as well as high availability of other opioids such as heroin in these commuting zones. Future research should explore potential mechanisms for the non-linearity of prescription opioid pills.},

  abstract = {The social relationship between an individual and their residential environment is shaped by a range of housing market rules and regulations, by residential choice and by constraints. This paper elaborates on that relationship by focusing on the distance between an individual's (and his/her household) social position and the social position of the neighbourhood of residence. Through the analysis of large-scale longitudinal register data for each resident in the four largest cities of the Netherlands, we studied the relations mentioned, as well as the residential moves triggered by such relations, as well as the outcome effects on individual-neighbourhood relations in the destination neighbourhoods. We found that the larger the social distance (positive or negative) between an individual and the median social position of their residential neighbourhood, the higher the odds that the individual would move from that neighbourhood. Those individuals that moved tended to select destination neighbourhoods that reduced their social distance. Our findings offer new input for debates and policies relating to de-segregation and social mixing.},

Using simulation models calibrated with administrative data for all primary and lower secondary schools in Stockholm, Sweden, we assess the potential impact of school closure on ethnic school segregation. More specifically, we study how the characteristics of the school to be closed, the local opportunity structure for the displaced students, and the student reallocation criteria influence the effects of school closures on school segregation. Our findings show that the change in ethnic school segregation is highly dependent on reallocation criteria and local opportunity structures. Moreover, they demonstrate that the current practices associated with school closures in large urban areas (i.e., closing minority-dominated schools in minority-dominated neighborhoods) are likely to be ineffective in reducing school segregation, especially when students are reallocated to their nearest school or to schools whose composition resembles that of their former schools.},

It is suggested that this process exemplifies a new era of partisan politics in the American South. Analyses of spatial regression models show that the geographical polarization can be partially explained by a tighter link between demographic characteristics and aggregate voting patterns, but that growth in spatial clustering cannot be attributed entirely to demographics. The possibility that spatially-bounded social contexts are affecting partisan change is thus explored. Finally, the article's findings are considered in light of the growing debate about geographical polarization in the American electorate. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The empirical data are from a comprehensive study of residential location and travel in Copenhagen Metropolitan Area. Differences between inner- and outer-area residents in activity frequencies and trip frequencies are modest and partly outweigh each other. However, differences in trip distances due to the location of the dwelling relative to concentrations of facilities translate into substantially longer total travelling distances among suburbanites than among inner-city residents.},

This and other submitted plans that adhered to the traditional reform criteria of compactness and not splitting political boundaries have half as much bias favoring Republicans as the unconstitutional map of 2011. For fairer maps, it appears to be necessary to ``anti-gerrymander'' by relaxing the traditional criteria in order to overcome the political geography in Pennsylvania which apparently makes a Democratic gerrymander practically impossible. The methodology uses five statewide data bases at the precinct level and suitably constructed seats/votes curves. If fairness and responsiveness are valued more than political geography, then they should be made explicit criteria in congressional districting, at least in Pennsylvania.},

We discuss the measurement of coagglomeration and use data from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Research Database from 1972 to 1997 to compute pairwise coagglomeration measurements for U.S. manufacturing industries. Industry attributes are used to construct measures of the relevance of each of Marshall's three theories of industry agglomeration to each industry pair: (1) agglomeration saves transport costs by proximity to input suppliers or final consumers, (2) agglomeration allows for labor market pooling, and (3) agglomeration facilitates intellectual spillovers. We assess the importance of the theories via regressions of coagglomeration indices on these measures. Data on characteristics of corresponding industries in the United Kingdom are used as instruments. We find evidence to support each mechanism. Our results suggest that input-output dependencies are the most important factor, followed by labor pooling.}

  abstract = {Displacement has been at the centre of heated analytical and political debates over gentrification and urban change for almost 40 years. A new generation of quantitative research has provided new evidence of the limited (and sometimes counter-intuitive) extent of displacement, supporting broader theoretical and political arguments favouring mixed-income redevelopment and other forms of gentrification. This paper offers a critical challenge to this interpretation, drawing on evidence from a mixed-methods study of gentrification and displacement in New York City. Quantitative analysis of the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey indicates that displacement is a limited yet crucial indicator of the deepening class polarisation of urban housing markets; moreover, the main buffers against gentrification-induced displacement of the poor (public housing and rent regulation) are precisely those kinds of market interventions that are being challenged by advocates of gentrification and dismantled by policy-makers. Qualitative analysis based on interviews with community organisers and residents documents the continued political salience of displacement and reveals an increasingly sophisticated and creative array of methods used to resist displacement in a policy climate emphasising selective deregulation and market-oriented social policy.

An appropriate strategy, therefore, is simultaneously to consider multiple measures that collectively define compactness. We identify and evaluate multiple operationalizations and compare them both theoretically and empirically. Data from five states provide abundant evidence that the major types of measures sometimes vary widely in their evaluation of the compactness of a given district. There is some support, however, for the hypothesis that multiple measures yield similar assessments of districting plans.

Adoption of such policies is more associated with two indicators of the new political culture (NPC)-the presence of environmental activist groups at the local level and the percent of college-educated residents-than with the percent of residents who are white or the percent who are homeowners. Conclusion. The smart growth movement at the local level is a product of the environmental concerns associated with the NPC and is more likely to influence the adoption of land-preserving policies than land-use-intensifying policies.},

  abstract = {The Bureau of the Census initially developed the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) database, a main component of the Master Address File/TIGER System (MAF/TIGER System), to provide geographic services and products in support of the 1990 decennial and other Census Bureau statistical programs. Since its inception, the public has used the TIGER/Line Files (public-released extracts of the TIGER database) in a variety of activities, many of which require a positional accuracy beyond the Bureau's initial needs. These many additional uses, coupled with the Bureau's anticipated positional accuracy requirements for successfully merging the functionality of the MAF and TIGER into a fully integrated system for use in future monthly programs and censuses, have made improving the positional accuracy of TIGER a Bureau goal to be accomplished ``beyond-2000.'' TIGER was built and has been continuously updated using a wide variety of source materials and techniques, including the GBF/DIME files, USGS 1:100,000-scale topographic maps, local and tribal maps, and enumerator updates of differing positional accuracy. Because of its varied update history, answering the question ``What is the positional accuracy of MAF/TIGER'' is not as straightforward as one might hope. This paper discusses the ways by which the positional accuracy of TIGER can be quantitatively measured and reported. Understanding the existing positional accuracy of TIGER is the first step toward attempting to improve the positional accuracy of TIGER. The Bureau is considering and testing courses of action for improving the positional accuracy of TIGER, focusing on differing data collection methodologies. These methodologies are reviewed.},

"It is concluded that ecological fallacy effects are endemic to areal census data, although their magnitude is perhaps not as large as might have been expected. The principal difficulty is that there is at present no way of predicting in advance the degree of severity likely to be associated with particular variables and particular techniques. Finally, a suggestion is made concerning how the potentially serious practical consequences can be reduced."},

Analysis of a series of correlations and means comparisons provides evidence that several factors are interrelated with local government engagement in sustainability initiatives, including population size, central city locations, diversity, ethnicity and race, political leanings of a community, and region. In addition, cities are ranked by their scores on this index creating a "best cases" list for future research.},

  abstract = {Purpose: School administrators and policy makers live in a complex, changing policy universe in which there are many competing demands and political pressures. Rarely is there much time to think about sensitive issues of long duration that are not part of the immediate demands they face. This article is about such an issue, a question that will deeply influence the future of schools and communities but which is usually ignored{\textemdash}the increasing separation of large sectors of our student bodies into intensely segregated schools with unequal educational opportunity. Research Methods: The data analyzed come from the National Center for Education Statistics, Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe, which contain demographic data about all public schools since the late 1980s. We rely on two measures of segregation, concentration and exposure/isolation index, to assess its current status and change over time in the nation's public schools. Findings: This article describes the vast transformation of the nation's school population since the civil rights era. As diversity spreads, so too does segregation by race and often class, including into suburbia in many large metropolitan areas. As a legacy of Brown, Black students are still more desegregated in the South than any other region of the country, but both Black and Latino students are experiencing rising segregation. Implications: We conclude with recommendations about possible responses educational Orfield and Frankenberg 719 leaders might pursue to make the promise of Brown a reality in the 21st century. Desegregation properly implemented can help equalize educational opportunities and prepare young Americans for the diverse society in which they will live. The inequality of many schools segregated by race and poverty is obvious to anyone who compares high-poverty Black or Latino schools with the schools of affluent White and Asian communities. The differences in segregated minority schools as compared with schools with more White and/or middle-class students include fewer educational resources such as teacher quality and experience, parent and student resources, stability of enrollment, and advanced instruction. The U.S. Supreme Court implemented a policy of " sep-arate but equal " for nearly six decades under Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), but inequality between Black and White schools was pervasive. Brown v. Board of Education (1954) was based on the Court's conclusion that separate schools were " inherently unequal " and began the largest constitutional change ever to affect American education. It declared that the racial policies of 17 states violated the Constitution. Almost all the leaders of the South fought it until change was forced (Sarratt, 1966). Later, as the civil rights revolution changed America, many educators took risks for this important goal. After politics and the courts changed, however, that leadership in facing and resolving racial challenges became far less common and the tacit assump-tion that segregation could be ignored spread. This article summarizes policy and legal developments since Brown v. Board of Education, presents new data on changing populations and intensifying segregation, and discusses possible responses by education leaders. American education must come to terms with three basic demographic, economic, and policy realities. First, the largest demographic transformation in American history has made " minorities " into the majority in much of our multiracial country including its two largest regions (Orfield \& Frankenberg, 2014). Second, the U.S. economy has left behind workers and families with-out needed educational credentials. As Latinos demographically displace many Whites in the school-aged population, the country's average educa-tional levels and economic success will decline if we do not better educate non-White children. Third, " separate but equal " has never succeeded on any significant scale because of the many forms of inequality embedded in at UNIV CALIFORNIA DAVIS on January 5, 2015 eaq.sagepub.com Downloaded from},

  volume = {9},

  abstract = {There is empirical evidence from a range of disciplines that as the connectivity of a network increases, we observe an increase in the average fitness of the system.  But at the same time, there is an increase in the proportion of failure/extinction events which are extremely large.  The probability of observing an extreme event remains very low, but it is markedly higher than in the system with lower degrees of connectivity. We are therefore concerned with systems whose properties are not static but which evolve dynamically over time. The focus in this paper, motivated by the empirical examples, is on networks in which the robustness or fragility of the vertices is not given, but which themselves evolve over time We give examples from complex systems such as outages in the US power grid, the robustness properties of cell biology networks, and trade links and the propagation of both currency crises and disease. We consider systems which are populated by agents which are heterogeneous in terms of their fitness for survival.  The agents are connected on a network, which evolves over time. In each period agents take self-interested decisions to increase their fitness for survival to form alliances which increase the connectivity of the network. The network is subjected to external negative shocks both with respect to the size of the shock and the spatial impact of the shock.  We examine the size/frequency distribution of extinctions and how this distribution evolves as the connectivity of the network grows.  The results are robust with respect to the choice of statistical distribution of the shocks. The model is deliberately kept as parsimonious and simple as possible, and refrains from incorporating features such as increasing returns and  externalities arising from preferential attachment which might bias the model in the direction of having the empirically observed features of many real world networks. The model still generates results consistent with the empirical evidence: increasing the number of connections causes an increase in the average fitness of agents, yet at the same time makes the system as whole more vulnerable to catastrophic failure/extinction events on an near-global scale.},

  abstract = {Aim Pediatric cancer has been associated with exposure to certain environmental carcinogens. The purpose of this work is to analyse the relationship between environmental pollution and pediatric cancer risk. Method We analysed all incidences of pediatric cancer ({$<$}15) diagnosed in a Spanish region during the period 1998{\textendash}2015. The place of residence of each patient and the exact geographical coordinates of main industrial facilities was codified in order to analyse the spatial distribution of cases of cancer in relation to industrial areas. Focal tests and focused Scan methodology were used for the identification of high-incidence-rate spatial clusters around the main industrial pollution foci. Results The crude rate for the period was 148.0 cases per 1,000,0000 children. The incidence of pediatric cancer increased significantly along the period of study. With respect to spatial distribution, results showed significant high incidence around some industrial pollution foci group and the Scan methodology identify spatial clustering. We observe a global major incidence of non Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) considering all foci, and high incidence of Sympathetic Nervous System Tumour (SNST) around Energy and Electric and organic and inorganic chemical industries foci group. In the analysis foci to foci, the focused Scan test identifies several significant spatial clusters. Particularly, three significant clusters were identified: the first of SNST was around energy-generating chemical industries (2 cases versus the expected 0.26), another of NHL was around residue-valorisation plants (5 cases versus the expected 0.91) and finally one cluster of Hodgkin lymphoma around building materials (3 cases versus the expected 2.2) Conclusion Results suggest a possible association between proximity to certain industries and pediatric cancer risk. More evidences are necessary before establishing the relationship between industrial pollution and pediatric cancer incidence.},

In this paper, agents' preferences for neighborhood mix are represented by bid-rent functions, and lots are allocated to the highest bidders. The agent-based simulation model shows that segregation occurs even if households prefer integrated neighborhoods, and the inefficiency of segregation is shown by a lower aggregate willingness to pay for land. The degree of segregation (measured by the dissimilarity index and the entropy index) varies with the share of agents who are indifferent about neighborhood mix. Several public policies-random assignment of agents to lots, minority subsidies, and side payment from neighborhood associations-promote integration and increase the aggregate willingness to pay for land. To explore the dynamics of segregation under different policy regimes, run the agent-based model online: http://www.lclark.edu/{\textasciitilde}arthuro/SortModelNew.html.},

  abstract = {In the Schelling model of residential sorting, preferences for neighborhood mix are expressed in terms of tolerance of unlike neighbors, and an agent moves when its tolerance threshold is exceeded. In this paper, agents' preferences for neighborhood mix are represented by bid-rent functions, and lots are allocated to the highest bidders. The agent-based simulation model shows that segregation occurs even if households prefer integrated neighborhoods, and the inefficiency of segregation is shown by a lower aggregate willingness to pay for land. The degree of segregation (measured by the dissimilarity index and the entropy index) varies with the share of agents who are indifferent about neighborhood mix. Several public policies-random assignment of agents to lots, minority subsidies, and side payment from neighborhood associations-promote integration and increase the aggregate willingness to pay for land. To explore the dynamics of segregation under different policy regimes, run the agent-based model online: http://www.lclark.edu/{\textasciitilde}arthuro/SortModelNew.html.},

Using the restricted detailed natality file from the National Center for Health Statistics, I analyze the impact of the oil and gas hydraulic fracturing boom in North Dakota and Montana on adolescent female fertility rates, testing pro-cyclical, mating market, and adult formation theories of adolescent fertility. Restricted difference-in-differences models demonstrate a positive and significant association between the oil boom and increased births in adolescent women aged 15{\textendash}19, but more fully specified models demonstrate changing economic and social conditions appear to be driving the effect. Leveraging the exogenous shock of a bust in oil prices, a comparative interrupted time-series regression demonstrates a sizeable year-over-year decrease in adolescent female fertility for the shale region. Fertility rate changes in this age group do not appear attributable to changing racial or ethnic composition of oil-producing counties. Instead, increases in adolescent female fertility are largely driven by increasing births among white teens. The proximate mechanism driving this effect is the increasing employed share of young men aged 14{\textendash}24, lending support to a substrand of adult formation and mating market explanations of adolescent female fertility.},

The location of assisted housing shapes where low-income assisted renters live, and it may also affect the residential choices of nonassisted residents. This article examines whether the deconcentration of assisted housing has reduced the segregation of families by income among neighborhoods in metropolitan areas from 1980 to 2005-9. I find that the deconcentration of assisted housing resulted in modest economic residential integration for very low-income families. However, high-income families became even more segregated, as assisted housing was deconcentrated, potentially offsetting the economic integration gains and ensuring that very low-income families are living in neighborhoods with only slightly higher-income neighbors. I conclude by discussing features of housing policies that might promote greater income integration among neighborhoods.},

Among childless households{\textemdash}two-thirds of the population{\textemdash}income segregation changed little and is half as large as among households with children. I examine two factors that may account for these differences by household composition. First, I find that increasing income inequality, identified by past research as a driver of income segregation, was a much more powerful predictor of income segregation among families with children, among whom income inequality has risen more. Second, I find that local school options, delineated by school district boundaries, contribute to higher segregation among households with children compared to households without. Rising income inequality provided high-income households more resources...},

Between-district income segregation of families with children enrolled in public school increased by over 15\% from 1990 to 2010. Within large districts, between-school segregation of students who are eligible and ineligible for free lunch increased by about 30\% from 1990 to 2010. Consistent with past research on neighborhood segregation, we find that rising income inequality contributed to the rise in income segregation between schools and districts during this period. The rise in income segregation between both schools and districts may have serious implications for inequality in students' access to resources that bear on academic achievement.},

  abstract = {Large achievement gaps exist between high- and low-income students and between black and white students. This article explores one explanation for such gaps: income segregation between school districts, which creates inequality in the economic and social resources available in advantaged and disadvantaged students' school contexts. Drawing on national data, I find that the income achievement gap is larger in highly segregated metropolitan areas. This is due mainly to high-income students performing better, rather than low-income children performing worse, in more-segregated places. Income segregation between districts also contributes to the racial achievement gap, largely because white students perform better in more economically segregated places. Descriptive portraits of the school districts of high- and low-income students show that income segregation creates affluent districts for high-income students while changing the contexts of low-income students negligibly. Considering income and race jointly, I find that only high-income white families live in the affluent districts created by income segregation; black families with identically high incomes live in districts more similar to those of low-income white families. My results demonstrate that the spatial inequalities created by income segregation between school districts contribute to achievement gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students, with implications for future research and policy.},

  abstract = {Many environmental justice studies have sought to examine the effect of residential segregation on unequal exposure to environmental factors among different social groups, but little is known about how segregation in non-residential contexts affects such disparity. Based on a review of the relevant literature, this paper discusses the limitations of traditional residence-based approaches in examining the association between socioeconomic or racial/ethnic segregation and unequal environmental exposure in environmental justice research. It emphasizes that future research needs to go beyond residential segregation by considering the full spectrum of segregation experienced by people in various geographic and temporal contexts of everyday life. Along with this comprehensive understanding of segregation, the paper also highlights the importance of assessing environmental exposure at a high spatiotemporal resolution in environmental justice research. The successful integration of a comprehensive concept of segregation, high-resolution data and fine-grained spatiotemporal approaches to assessing segregation and environmental exposure would provide more nuanced and robust findings on the associations between segregation and disparities in environmental exposure and their health impacts. Moreover, it would also contribute to significantly expanding the scope of environmental justice research.},

  abstract = {This study aims to empirically demonstrate the necessity to consider both the spatiotemporal variability of air pollution and individual daily movement patterns in exposure and health risk assessment. It compares four different types of exposure estimates generated by using (1) individual movement data and hourly air pollution concentrations; (2) individual movement data and daily average air pollution data; (3) residential location and hourly pollution levels; and (4) residential location and daily average pollution data. These four estimates are significantly different, which supports the argument that ignoring the spatiotemporal variability of environmental risk factors and human mobility may lead to misleading results in exposure assessment. Additionally, three-dimensional (3D) geovisualization presented in the paper shows how person-specific space-time context is generated by the interactions between air pollution and an individual, and how the different individualized contexts place individuals at different levels of health risk.},

  abstract = {Canadian regional population growth is less understood than that of the United States. In both countries, certain regions have persistent population growth. Yet, unlike U.S. trends of amenity-driven migration away from historic urban centres, Canadian growth is more urban centric. This study assesses whether agglomeration economies in the few major Canadian metropolitan areas lead to population growth in or near these cities rather than the more-dispersed U.S. patterns. The results suggest that disparities such as the concentration of Canadians along its southern border may explain migration patterns, indicating that key differences in initial conditions may produce different outcomes between the two countries.

  abstract = {Vancouver, British Columbia, recently hosted the third United Nations World Urban Forum. Its theme was the sustainability of cities. The event marked the 30th anniversary of the first U.N. conference on human settlements, held in Vancouver in 1976.  Commissioner general for WUF3 was Charles Kelly, a Canadian with ties to Seattle through the Vancouver, B.C.-based Cascadia Institute. Kelly and Paul Daniell of the institute convened a Canada-United States panel on the opening day of the forum.  The panel focused on two topics: competition and cooperation in the North American port gateway system, and how movement of goods affects the sustainability of our urban areas. I had the privilege of serving as moderator for the dialogue among five Canadian and four American panelists.  Perspectives came from the landlocked but resource-rich Yukon Territory, major marine ports in British Columbia and the U.S. Northwest, a thriving "inland port" in southern Oregon, and the Southern California megalopolis.  Dave Frank of the University of British Columbia set the tone. "Due to explosive growth on the West Coast, we have a unique opportunity to avoid destructive competition. Together we must find a way to be in the middle of the action, or we will be on the side."  Frank said, "To make goods movement sustainable, we must be as efficient as possible. This means 'intelligent gateways' that link truck and rail through information flows about cargo and carriers."  Jennifer Ziegler, transportation policy adviser to Gov. Chris Gregoire, described the freight rail system in Washington as "at or near capacity." Ziegler said a major research finding is that lack of regional rail capacity does not cause marine cargo to shift to trucks but to move to other port gateways. Another finding is that an overflow on the east-west rail system increases pressure on the north-south system.  "Rail is a particular challenge because it requires a variety of financial partners. There is also the challenge of the right balance between freight and passenger rail, which have different requirements but often share the same tracks," Ziegler noted.  A thriving freight management center is the Rogue Valley in southern Oregon. "With the decline of timber, we realized that freight movement is our growth industry," reported Mike Quilty, chair of the region's metropolitan planning organization.  "We have become an inland gateway between the Northwest and California," Quilty said. "The Port of Portland is helping us develop as an inland port. They figure 85 percent of the through-put will never pass through their gates. Instead, we will assemble trainloads of semi-trailers that benefit both rail and truck companies."  Yukon Deputy Minister of Economic Development Eugene Lysy described the Yukon as rich in natural resources. "We are working with Alaska on a rail study to move cargo to B.C. and on port access through Alaska. An Alaska-Canada trade corridor could provide a solution for the Yukon and also could increase container cargo capacity for North America."  Lysy added, "In the Far North, congestion is not an issue. But we do have issues in protecting sustainability. We have large undeveloped areas in a sensitive ecological region. We also have 'first nations' people. Rail is attractive because it builds capacity while restricting impact."  Hugh Conroy of the Bellingham-based Whatcom Council of Governments works intensively on improving "Cascade Gateway" border crossings between Washington and British Columbia. "Landside access issues adjacent to ports are key," Conroy said. "One response to rail restrictions is short-sea shipping. This 'water option' is a way to enable container repositioning while relieving landside congestion."  Long Beach, Calif.-based Frank Hotchkiss is former director of strategic planning for the Southern California Association of Governments. "There is more than enough trade for everybody. In fact, cargo growth can rip an urban region apart," Hotchkiss observed. "The impact on a region like mine is almost overwhelming. We need to respond not only with changes in goods movement but in urban structure. Bypassing cities with added port capacity is an essential ingredient."  Hotchkiss believes that as ports invest in the future, it is crucial to include Prince Rupert in British Columbia and Punta Colonet in Baja California. "These new locations can help relieve congestion by providing dispersion. They would be the first major ports that are not sited in a major urban area," he noted.  In the same spirit of larger thinking, Peter Holt, CEO of the Surrey, British Columbia, Chamber of Commerce and chairman of the Lower Mainland Chamber of Commerce Transportation Panel, addressed the question: How does Prince Rupert affect the Vancouver ports?  "We need to recognize that a gateway is not a point; it is a region," he said. "Vancouver is the southern gateway and Prince Rupert is the northern gateway in the B.C. gateway region."  A question came from the audience. Vancouver urban planner Michael Morrison asked, "You have talked about cities strangling ports. When does a port start to strangle a city?" Holt responded, "It's not most productive to ask if ports or cities are strangling each other. How can they co-exist?"  Allan Baydala, CEO of the North Fraser Port Authority in British Columbia, observed that "ports respond to demand from the region and even from the continent. How can we address this in a broader sense? Through more inclusive planning with citizens as well as ports. Involving all stakeholders up front is far better than crisis management in the face of a backlash."  Conroy commented, "In the context of expanding global trade, do ports have to be huge to be viable?" Baydala continued the self-questioning: "Are urban ports sustainable? Access to land is a major issue. There is talk of creating 'industrial land reserves' around ports."  The issue also affects inland ports, Quilty noted. "Oregon's land use law requires that proposed changes in land use will not damage uses on adjacent land. This especially affects industrial land as residential development pressures increase. Our region is setting aside land reserves for the next 40 to 50 years. The question is, will they survive the next round of attractive development proposals?"  Pat Cruickshank, regional manager for the British Columbia Ministry of Transport, carries the Gateway file with the Canadian federal government. Using words that resonate along the West Coast, he observed, "There has been no significant improvement to our goods movement network in 20 years. Yet in the same time period, Vancouver-area jobs have grown by 60 percent -- from 1 million to 1.6 million. It is not surprising that transportation ranks as the No. 1 concern in the region."  Holt concluded, "With regard to sustainability, the key word is efficiency in handling and moving goods. The situation is not static. Sustainability is about responding to growth and change."

In common with other plurality-based electoral systems, the College tends to exaggerate the apparent mandate received by the winner of the popular vote but, on occasion, can deliver victory to the second-placed candidate. Despite a sizeable literature on its operation and vagaries, however, relatively little attention has been paid to the question of systematic bias in the College: does one party receive a consistent advantage over the other from the College's operation? The paper examines the evidence for such a bias in each Presidential election since 1960. Although biases have occurred and in some cases were substantial, neither major party is a consistent beneficiary; the prime source of bias is to be found in the relative effectiveness of parties' own vote-winning strategies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The combination of government support and developer initiatives indicates potential for the gentrification of brownfields. However, developer proposals to expedite the conversion of contaminated properties along the Gowanus Canal in New York City into residential and commercial venues resulted in the addition of the canal to the US National Priorities List (NPL) of uncontrolled hazardous sites, rendering the site less attractive to developers. It is argued that the listing process became an effective tool in the struggle to resist gentrification in the Gowanus Canal neighbourhood. Place stigmatisation slowed developer-driven redevelopment and the NPL designation allows for a comprehensive remediation approach and increases opportunities for community input. This study provides an interesting case study of resistance to developer-driven  smart-city' planning that represents a meaningful departure from neoliberal urbanism.},

Poverty grew fastest between 2000 and 2005-2009 in tracts that began the decade with high levels of rented one- to four-family housing, multifamily housing, housing between 20 and 25 years old, and households paying over 30\% of their income for housing costs. In addition, poverty grew fastest in tracts with high percentages of black or Hispanic households in 2000.},

  abstract = {There is no theoretical reason to assume that neighborhood effects operate at a constant single spatial scale across multiple urban settings or over different periods of time. Despite this, many studies use large, single-scale, predefined spatial units as proxies for neighborhoods. Recently, the use of bespoke neighborhoods has challenged the predominant approach to neighborhood as a single static unit. This article argues that we need to move away from neighborhood effects and study multiscale context effects. The article systematically examines how estimates of spatial contextual effects vary when altering the spatial scale of context, how this translates across urban space, and what the consequences are when using an inappropriate scale, in the absence of theory. Using individual-level geocoded data from The Netherlands, we created 101 bespoke areas around each individual. We ran 101 models of personal income to examine the effect of living in a low-income spatial context, focusing on four distinct regions. We found that contextual effects vary over both scales and urban settings, with the largest effects not necessarily present at the smallest spatial scale. Ultimately, the magnitude of contextual effects is determined by various spatial processes, along with the variability in urban structure. Therefore, using an inappropriate spatial scale can considerably bias (upward or downward) spatial context effects.},

The results suggest that the availability of legitimate and illegitimate capital greatly affects the trajectory and the length of gang involvement. Also, gangs provide significant material and social capital for the respondents of the study.},

This second paper focuses on issues of econometric-model design and empirical validation. Given the practical limitations imposed by data availability, the `soft' theories of local economic growth are modeled by a simple conditional `gap' convergence model in which prevailing regional unemployment relativities are determined by a common trend in unemploy- ment and a set of regionally specific variables. The empirical validity of the competing `soft' theories of local economic growth is evaluated by applying test restrictions imposed by the `soft' theories to a general model specification containing eight regionally specific variables that have been identified as potential drivers of local economic growth. The econometric modeling of Australian data suggests that the processes of regional economic performance might be somewhat different from those specified in individual theoretical models. Significantly, the role of local `enterprise culture' is revealed{\"o}built on specialization, technological leadership, human resources, and the local integration of firms{\"o} though significant caveats are attached to the roles of access to information, institutional support, and interregional trade as promoters of local economic growth.},

The lack of businesses and jobs in disadvantaged urban areas fuels not only a crushing cycle of poverty but also crippling social problems such as drug abuse and crime. And, as inner cities continue to deteriorate, the debate on how to aid them grows increasingly divisive. The sad reality is that the efforts of the past several decades to revitalize inner cities have failed. The establishment of a sustainable economic base--and with it employment opportunities, wealth creation, role models, and improved local infrastructure--still eludes us despite the investment of substantial resources. The time has come to recognize that revitalizing the inner cities will require a radically new approach. While social programs will continue to play a critical role in meeting human needs and improving education, they must support--and not undermine--a coherent economic strategy. The question we should be asking is how inner-city-based businesses and nearby employment opportunities for inner city residents can proliferate and grow. A sustainable economic base can be created in the inner city, but only as it has been created elsewhere: through private, for-profit initiatives and investment based on economic self-interest and genuine competitive advantage. An economic model must begin with the premise that inner city businesses must be profitable and positioned to compete on a regional, national, and even international scale. Our policies and programs have fallen into the trap of redistributing wealth. The real need--as well as the real opportunity--is to create wealth.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, population dynamics, have made definitions of what localities are rural or urban somewhat unclear. The vast majority of demographic work has simply used metropolitan classifications with various forms of a non-metropolitan residual (e.g., adjacent to metro versus non-adjacent). The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) periodically redefines metropolitan areas, which makes temporal comparisons difficult. In fact, some demographers have offered the idea that, due to these shifting reclassifications, the so-called ``rural rebound'' is a misnomer, in that non-metropolitan counties that transitioned to metropolitan status were, in fact, already more `urban' than those that did not become reclassified as metropolitan (Johnson et al 2005). This argument depends largely on the assumption of homogeneity in rural or urban `character' in those counties. Following arguments by others (Wilkinson 1991; Isserman 2001; Bogue 1950), we take population and land use into account to examine whether these transitional counties were more or less urban than comparable others, all at the county level for the contiguous 48 states for 1970{\textendash}2000. Our results show that adjacent non-metropolitan counties that were later reclassified as metropolitan were indeed characterized by a larger population and heavier urban land cover than those not making this transition. However, the results also show that metropolitan areas were also quite heterogeneous in terms of traditionally rural activities. A discussion of the homogeneity assumption in demographers' conceptualization of metropolitan areas is included.},

Do these statistics illuminate social reality and produce coherent social policy, or cloud that reality and confuse social policy? Does America still have a color line? Who is on which side? Does it have a different "race" line--the nativity line--separating the native born from the foreign born? You might expect to answer these and similar questions with the government's "statistical races." Not likely, observes Kenneth Prewitt, who shows why the way we count by race is flawed. Prewitt calls for radical change. The nation needs to move beyond a race classification whose origins are in discredited eighteenth-century race-is-biology science, a classification that once defined Japanese and Chinese as separate races, but now combines them as a statistical "Asian race." One that once tried to divide the "white race" into "good whites" and "bad whites," and that today cannot distinguish descendants of Africans brought in chains four hundred years ago from children of Ethiopian parents who eagerly immigrated twenty years ago. Contrary to common sense, the classification says there are only two ethnicities in America--Hispanics and non-Hispanics. But if the old classification is cast aside, is there something better? What Is Your Race ? clearly lays out the steps that can take the nation from where it is to where it needs to be. It's not an overnight task--particularly the explosive step of dropping today's race question from the census--but Prewitt argues persuasively that radical change is technically and politically achievable, and morally necessary.},

These models already made reference to the theories of self-organisation and to mechanisms of evolution not so far from those used today to describe the emergence of macroscopic properties or structures in a bottom-up process from interactions operating at the microlevel. Moreover there is less difference than often suggested in the literature between the two forms of modelling  -  differential equations and multi-agent models - in the way they integrate principles of urban theory. To test this assumption, we compare models made of systems of differential equations (Allen's model firmly rooted in self-organisation theory and the model developed by Weidlich and Haag, affiliated to synergetic theory) with multi-agent models (SIMPOP family) designed to meet the same task: simulating the differentiated dynamics of urban entities over the medium to long term from their functional economic specialisation. We show that multi-agent systems are providing interesting solutions for the modelling method, because of their greater ability to simulate the emergence of geographical macrostructures from different levels of interaction.

  abstract = {This article examines the effects of residential segregation on the basis of poverty status and race for high school and college completion. Segregation effects are estimated by contrasting educational outcomes among persons raised in met- ropolitan areas with varying levels of segregation. This metropolitan-level approach provides two advantages in evalu- ating segregation effects over neighborhood effects studies: it incorporates effects of residential segregation outside of the affected individuals' neighborhoods of residence and it allows evaluation of gains and losses across groups from segregation. Data are drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the decennial censuses. Poor{\textendash}nonpoor seg- regation is associated with lower rates of high school graduation among adolescents from poor backgrounds, but has no effect on rates of graduation for students from nonpoor backgrounds. Black{\textendash}white segregation is associated with lower rates of high school graduation and college graduation for black students, but has no effect on graduation rates forwhite students.

  abstract = {This article contrasts traditional modeling approaches and discrete-choice models as methods to analyze locational attainment--how individual and household characteristics (such as race, socioeconomic status, age) influence the characteristics of neighborhoods of residence (such as racial composition and median income). Traditional models analyze attributes of a neighborhood as a function of the characteristics of the households within them; discrete-choice methods, on the other hand, are based on dyadic analysis of neighborhood attributes and household characteristics. I outline two problems with traditional approaches to residential mobility analysis that may be addressed through discrete-choice analysis. I also discuss disadvantages of the discrete-choice approach. Finally, I use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to estimate residential mobility using traditional locational attainment and discrete-choice models; I show that these produce similar estimates but that the discrete-choice approach allows for estimates that examine how multiple place characteristics simultaneously guide migration. Substantively, these models reveal that the disproportionate migration of black households into lower-income tracts amounts to sorting of black households into black tracts, which on average are lower income.},

In this piece I draw from Gloria Anzald{\'u}a's Borderlands and engage with Black geographic thought, urban and sound studies to build a borderlands analytic. I consider how the ``tension, ambivalence and unrest'' of the borderlands provides a lens to understand the volatility of cities gripped by rapid gentrification. Using a borderlands analytic to make sense of the borders that are produced and policed in gentrifying cities, I consider how Black and Latinx life has been criminalized spatially and sonically so as to be displaced by forces of racial capitalist extraction. To do this, I look to the implementation of gang injunction zones in Oakland in 2010, and then to two moments in 2015 when the city's soundscapes were policed and criminalized. This piece centers the Black and Latinx geographies experiencing dispossession in Oakland, and considers how residents are imagining and fighting for their city's future.},

In many countries this is usually accomplished using address range TIGER-type files in conjunction with geocoding packages within a GIS. Improvements in GIS functionality and the storage capacity of large databases mean that the spatial investigation of data at the individual address level is now commonly performed. This process relies on the accuracy of the geocoding mechanism and this paper examines this accuracy in relation to cadastral records and census tracts. Results from a study of over 20 000 addresses in Sydney, Australia, using a TIGER-type geocoding process suggest that 5-7.5\% (depending on geocoding method) of addresses may be misallocated to census tracts, and more than 50\% may be given coordinates within the land parcel of a different property.},

We evalu- ate these six indices against a set of seven desirable properties of segregation indices. We conclude that the information theory index H is the most conceptually and mathematically satisfac- tory index, since it alone obeys the principle of transfers in the multigroup case. Moreover, H is the only multigroup index that can be decomposed into a sum of between- and within-group components.},

We find that racial school segregation in these districts in- creased gradually following release from court order, relative to the trends in segregation in districts remaining under court order. These increases are more pronounced in the South, in elementary grades, and in districts where prerelease school segregation levels were low. These results suggest that court-ordered desegregation plans are effective in reducing racial school segregation, but that their effects fade over time in the absence of continued court oversight.},

  abstract = {Since the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, researchers and policy makers have paid close attention to trends in school segregation. Here we review the evidence regarding trends and consequences of both racial and economic school segregation since Brown. The evidence suggests that the most significant declines in black-white school segregation occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s. There is disagreement about the direction of more recent trends in racial segregation, largely driven by how one defines and measures segregation. Depending on the definition used, segregation has either increased substantially or changed little, although there are important differences in the trends across regions, racial groups, and institutional levels. Limited evidence on school economic segregation makes documenting trends difficult, but students appear to be more segregated by income across schools and districts today than in 1990. We also discuss the role of desegregation litigation, demographic changes, and residential segregation in shaping trends in both racial and economic segregation. We develop a general conceptual model of how and why school segregation might affect students and review the relatively thin body of empirical evidence that explicitly assesses the consequences of school segregation. We conclude with a discussion of aspects of school segregation on which further research is needed.},

These disparities may in turn produce inequality in social and economic opportunities and outcomes. Because racial and socioeconomic segregation are not independent of each other, however, any analysis of their causes, patterns, and effects must rest on an understanding of the joint distribution of race/ethnicity and income among neighborhoods. In this article, we use a new technique to describe the average racial composition and income distributions in the neighborhoods of households with different income levels and race/ethnicity. Using data from the decennial censuses and the American Community Survey, we investigate how patterns of neighborhood context in the United States over the past two decades vary by household race/ethnicity, income, and metropolitan area. We find large and persistent racial differences in neighborhood context, even among households with the same annual income.},

The articles in the symposium make clear that it is possible to empirically identify a parsimonious taxonomy of local civic cultures focusing on systems of community power, values, and decision-making. While many questions about the internal dynamics of each type remain to be answered, the civic cultures identified here appear empirically distinct and theoretically logical.

  abstract = {Although policy evaluations have raised significant concerns about the effectiveness of individual incentives such as tax abatements and special taxing districts, they beg the question of whether, in the right combination, these tools might actually work. This research focuses on this question: Are some incentives more effective in particular combinations as they would normally be applied in reality? Based on an assessment of five widely used economic development programs in the state of Michigan, the research concludes that even in combination, many commonly used incentives have no relationship to the economic health of city residents. Programs that include performance guarantees, particularly related to jobs, appear promising. For many, particularly smaller, cities offering no economic development incentives also appears to be a promising course of action.},

I show how a space for biotechnology was created and maintained outside of the capitalist milieu with which the industry has come to be associated in the West. More specifically, I reveal how the formal demands made by the Cuban state of this biotechnology endeavour paradoxically encouraged the development of a suite of informal and innovative scientific practices. To account for how this very different approach nevertheless resulted in a similar 'regional culture' of innovation to that found in high-technology regions in the West, I suggest we need to consider not just the structural components of regional cultures (labour mobility, attitudes to risk, etc) but also the forms of rationality that underpin such factors themselves. In order to do this I turn to some of the insights of the science-studies literature as to the epistemological foundations of processes of innovation and knowledge production, to argue that regional cultures of innovation are never just economic spaces, they are also epistemic spaces.},

We analyzed population-based childhood cancer incidence rates in California (USA) from 1988 to 1994, by HAP exposure scores, for all California census tracts. For each census tract, we calculated exposure scores by combining cancer potency factors with outdoor HAP concentrations modeled by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We evaluated the relationship between childhood cancer rates and exposure scores for 25 potentially carcinogenic HAPs emitted from mobile, area, and point sources and from all sources combined. Our study period saw 7,143 newly diagnosed cancer cases in California; of these, 6,989 (97.8\%) could be assigned to census tracts and included in our analysis. Using Poisson regression, we estimated rate ratios (RRs) adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and sex. We found little evidence for elevated cancer RRs for all sites or for gliomas among children living in high-ranking combined-source exposure areas. We found elevated RRs and a significant trend with increasing exposure level for childhood leukemia in tracts ranked highest for exposure to the combined group of 25 HAPs (RR = 1.21; 95\% confidence interval, 1.03, 1.42) and in tracts ranked highest for point-source HAP exposure (RR = 1.32; 95\% confidence interval, 1.11, 1.57). Our findings suggest an association between increased childhood leukemia rates and high HAP exposure, but studies involving more comprehensive exposure assessment and individual-level exposure data will be important for elucidating this relationship.},

The practice of gerrymandering can easily take place if the shape of electoral districts is not controlled. In this paper we consider the following formulation of the political districting problem: given a connected graph (ter- ritory) with n nodes (territorial units), partition its set of nodes into k classes such that the subgraph induced by each class (district) is connected and a given vector of functions of the partition is minimized. The nonlinearity of such functions and the connectivity constraints make this network optimization problem a very hard one. Thus, the use of local search heu- ristics is justified. Experimentation on a sample of medium-large real-life instances has been carried out in order to com- pare the performance of four local search metaheuristics, i.e., Descent, Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing, and Old Bachelor Acceptance. Our experiments with Italian political districting provided strong evidence in favor of the use of automatic procedures. Actually, except for Descent, all local search algorithms showed a very good performance for this problem. In particular, in our sample of regions, Old Bachelor Acceptance produced the best results in the majority of the cases, especially when the objective function was compactness. Moreover, the district maps generated by this heuristic dominate the institutional district plan with respect to all the districting criteria under consideration. When properly designed, automatic procedures tend to be impartial and yield good districting alternatives. Moreover, they are remarkably fast, and thus they allow for the exploration of a large number of scenarios. {\'O}},

In particular, in our sample of regions, Old Bachelor Acceptance produced the best results in the majority of the cases, especially when the objective function was compactness. Moreover, the district maps generated by this heuristic dominate the institutional district plan with respect to all the districting criteria under consideration. When properly designed, automatic procedures tend to be impartial and yield good districting alternatives. Moreover, they are remarkably fast, and thus they allow for the exploration of a large number of scenarios. {\'O}},

  abstract = {Robust literatures separately estimate school effects and neighborhood effects on children's educational, economic, health, and other outcomes that measure well-being. A growing body of research acknowledges that both contexts matter and considers neighborhoods and schools jointly. In this review, we synthesize the array of results that emerge from these studies and critique the tendency for researchers to evaluate which matters more, neighborhoods versus schools. We propose a reorientation of this scholarship that incorporates research on neighborhood and school selection and segregation processes. We argue that contextual effects research would be enriched by considering local neighborhood{\textendash}school structures: the ways that families choose neighborhoods and schools and that neighborhoods and schools mutually and cyclically constitute one another. We conclude with recommendations for bringing neighborhood{\textendash}school structures to bear on both outcomes-oriented studies of neighborhood and school effects as well as studies of contextual selection and segregation.

I estimate the effect of gerrymandering on school diversity and school district segregation by comparing the racial/ethnic characteristics of existing attendance zones to those of counterfactual zones expected in the absence of gerrymandering. Results indicate that the gerrymandering of attendance zones generally exacerbates segregation, although it has a weaker effect on the segregation of Whites from Blacks and Hispanics. Gerrymandering is particularly segregative in districts experiencing rapid racial/ethnic change. However, gerrymandering is associated with reduc- tions in segregation in a substantial minority of districts, notably those under desegregation orders.},

  abstract = {Context: Despite the recent emphasis on public school choice, more than four-fifths of public school students still attend the traditional school to which they are assigned (NCES CCD, 2013), making attendance zone boundaries critical and fiercely contested determinants of educational opportunity. Historical and anecdotal evidence suggests that attendance zone boundaries are not ``accidents of geography,'' but have been ``gerrymandered'' into irregular shapes in ways that alter patterns of student attendance. However, no empirical evidence has directly examined the issue of attendance zone gerrymandering. Purpose of Study: Drawing on the literature on electoral gerrymandering, we outline a framework for conceptualizing and measuring educational gerrymandering. Using geospatial techniques, we then provide initial empirical evidence on the gerrymandering of school attendance zones and the variation in gerrymandering across geographic and demographic contexts. Research Design: We analyze the boundaries of a large national sample of 23,945 school attendance zones obtained from the School Attendance Boundary Information System (SABINS). For each attendance zone, we compute complementary measures assessing two dimensions of gerrymandering: (1) dispersion, or the elongation of the area of a boundary; and (2) indentation, or the irregularity of the perimeter of a boundary. Results: Overall, we find that attendance zones are highly gerrymandered{\textemdash}nearly as much as legislative districts{\textemdash}and are becoming more gerrymandered over time. Findings underscore the racial and, to a lesser extent, socioeconomic character of gerrymandering, which is particularly acute in Whiter and more affluent schools and in areas experiencing rapid racial change. Conclusions: The gerrymandering of school attendance zones has significant implications for students and schools. Gerrymandering alters patterns of attendance and, thereby, student access to educational opportunity and resources, by ``zoning out'' certain students living closer to schools while ``zoning in'' others living farther away. Gerrymandered boundaries also hold the potential to significantly alter the racial and ethnic composition of schools and may serve as a mechanism of segregation. In addition, gerrymandered attendance zones are inherently inefficient and may impose additional transportation costs on students and districts. We conclude with implications for state and federal policy. area for the coveted Penn Alexander school (Mezzacappa, 2013). In recent years, parents in Ohio, Connecticut, Kentucky and Missouri have faced criminal charges of ``educational theft'' for falsifying their place of residence to send their children to ``better'' schools (Flaherty, 2011). In Loudoun County, Virginia, one of the most affluent school districts in the country, hundreds of concerned parents attended contentious public forums dressed in color-coded shirts representing their communities to protest the proposed boundaries of their school district's attendance zoning plan (Gibson, 2013).

While these options continue to grow in the United States under the umbrella of school choice, magnet and charter schools are the most common forms of public school choice. In this article, we review the development of school choice and the differing historical and philosophical origins of magnet and charter schools. We then summarize what we know about the extent to which these public choice options exacerbate or ameliorate two forms of inequality{\textemdash}academic achievement and school segregation by race and class. Research suggests that magnet schools often encourage racial and class diversity, while charters contribute to racial and socioeconomic isolation. While low-income minority students may benefit academically from attending magnet schools, it is unclear whether charter schools have any effect on achievement when comparing charter school students to their counterparts in traditional public school. We expect that continued growth of magnet schools will likely promote school diversity both within and between districts, though some types of magnets may also inadvertently promote segregation. However, expansion of the charter school sector will heighten school segregation and exacerbate racial and socioeconomic isolation.},

We then analyze an original longitudinal study of approximately six hundred Angelenos from 2000 to 2013, assessing the degree to which contextual changes in neighborhood income arise from neighborhood-level mobility or individual residential mobility. Overall we find deep and persistent inequality among both neighborhoods and individuals. Contrary to prior research, we also find that residential mobility does not materially alter neighborhood economic conditions for most race, ethnic, and income groups. Our analyses lay the groundwork for a multilevel theoretical framework capable of explaining spatial inequality across cities and historical eras.},

Many place exclusive blame on partisan gerrymandering and voter suppression. But as political scientist Jonathan A. Rodden demonstrates in Why Cities Lose, the left's electoral challenges have deeper roots in economic and political geography.In the late nineteenth century, support for the left began to cluster in cities among the industrial working class. Today, left-wing parties have become coalitions of diverse urban interest groups, from racial minorities to the creative class. These parties win big in urban districts but struggle to capture the suburban and rural seats necessary for legislative majorities. A bold new interpretation of today's urban-rural political conflict, Why Cities Lose also points to electoral reforms that could address the left's under-representation while reducing urban-rural polarization.},

Poor development prospects and an increasing belief that these places have 'no future' {\^a}{\texteuro}`` as economic dynamism has been posited to be increasingly dependent on agglomeration economies {\^a}{\texteuro}`` have led many of these so-called 'places that don't matter' to revolt against the status quo. The revolt has come via an unexpected source: the ballot-box in a wave of political populism with strong territorial, rather than social foundations. I will argue that the populist wave is challenging the sources of existing well-being in both the less-dynamic and the more prosperous areas and that better, rather than more, place-sensitive territorial development policies are needed in order to find a solution to the problem. Place-sensitive development policies need, however, to stay clear of the welfare, income-support, and big investment projects of past development strategies if they are to be successful and focus on tapping into untapped potential and on providing opportunities to those people living in the places that 'don't matter'.},

Bishop argued this has increased as the result of residential location decisions: Democratic Party supporters have increasingly moved to neighborhoods where others of that persuasion are already congregated, for example. His analyses at the county scale are geographically incommensurate with that argument, however; the lacuna is filled using precinct-level data for the entire United States for the 2008, 2012 and 2016 presidential elections. Multi-level modelling shows polarization at those elections was significantly greater at the precinct than the county, state and division scales. Change over the three elections at the precinct scale was probably associated with redistricting and reduced support from the Democratic Party by some groups.},

Much of the urban studies and planning literature defines segregation as a measure of residential mixing. In contrast, our research suggests that segregation could be understood as a lack of opportunities for interaction in public space. In the case of Stockholm, space syntax network analysis and the establishment of ethnicity as a statistical category suggest that despite the social infrastructure provided by the Swedish state, the city's specific spatial configuration alongside its policies of housing allocation have resulted in severe constraints on the potential for co-presence between new immigrants and the native Swedish population. Spatial analysis suggests that the city's public transport infrastructure is a contributory factor in maintaining separation between foreign-born and ethnic Swedes.

This creates incentives for immigration. Depending on the relative strength of the centrifugal force, full agglomeration of all workers in one region can result even with perfectly identical regions. This creates an incentive for the local governments in each region to provide the public good strategically leading to overprovision and suboptimal agglomeration.},

  abstract = {The naming of places is one of the primary ways in which the spatial imaginaries of colonialism have been entrenched within the spaces of everyday life in settler-colonial societies. Consequently, the reclaiming of Indigenous toponymies has become a key strategy for decolonizing space and place in the neocolonial present, thereby revalorizing place-based Indigenous ontologies and challenging the neocolonial state's assertions of authority over geographical naming practices. This article examines the efforts of Indigenous peoples in {\textsubbar W}S{\'A}NE{\'C} and Lekwungen Territories to reclaim their ``storyscapes'' through the renaming of PKOLS, a mountain known by the settler society as Mount Douglas in Saanich, British Columbia. In doing so, this study highlights how the reassertion of Indigenous ontologies of place challenges the white supremacist logic embedded in the commemorative landscapes of settler colonialism as part of the broader struggle for Indigenous self-determination. The article also draws attention to how institutions of higher education are themselves implicated in the legitimation of settler-colonial spatial imaginaries and calls upon scholars and activists to move beyond a politics of recognition, which reinforces the authority of the settlercolonial state, by decentering the heroics of settler political agency in the struggle for decolonization both on and off university campuses.},

  abstract = {This paper considers an unexamined mechanism in the selection processes that sort the urban poor into different neighborhood environments: the landlord. Scholars of poverty and residential mobility have long been interested in how the choices of low-income families interact with structural barriers to create high-poverty neigh- borhoods that reproduce social and economic isolation as well as racial segregation. However, they have not examined the ways in which these choices are shaped by the intermediary force of the landlord. This paper draws on ethnographic observation and in-depth interviews with 20 landlords and 82 residents in Baltimore, examin- ing their engagement with the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program. Findings show that landlords' strategic implementations of voucher rules contribute to res- idential sorting patterns through a three-step process: first, selection, in which tar- geted recruitment tactics favor voucher tenants; second, a sorting process in which landlords cherry-pick the lower-end voucher tenants, matching them to hard-to- rent units; and third, landlords' selective retention of tenants who do not have the means to leave. This results in rigging the game, where a process of ``reverse selec- tion'' operates: Rather than tenants selecting homes and neighborhoods, landlords are selecting tenants. Taken together, these tactics result in a strategic balkanization of the rental housing market that retains voucher holders where they can be most profitable{\textemdash}in the very neighborhoods policymakers would like to provide them with the opportunity to leave. Landlord tactics serve as a powerful mechanism in the concentration of poverty.},

The study is motivated by the relative lack of attention paid to residential segregation by income in the Canadian context and by conceptual arguments linking compromised life chances and increased social tensions for the populations of highly segregated cities. We investigated several dimensions of segregation using five different measures (we focus on three of these here given the correlation structure of the measures) to examine changes in segregation between 1991 and 1996, a period characterised by economic recession, cutbacks in social programs and a widening of inequality in market incomes at the national scale. Overall, income segregation increased in most urban areas across all dimensions of segregation during the time period, with particularly high degrees of segregation observed in prairie cities (Winnipeg, Saskatoon and Regina). Of the three largest metropolitan areas (Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal), Montreal was the most consistently segregated. We also find that increases in spatial separation and spatial concentration by income occurred despite the fact that at the national scale, the tax and transfer system appeared to be adequately redressing a rise in inequality in labour and market incomes (as demonstrated by the lack of change in post-transfer national income inequality measures during a period when inequality in market and labour incomes rose sharply). This implies that the lived experience of changes in income distribution are unlikely fully captured by aspatial, national-scale measures and that intra-urban measures with a spatial dimension are an important indicators of inequality in Canadian society.},

  abstract = {The process of congressional redistricting, delineating boundaries for districts in which voters elect members to the U.S. House of Representatives, has always been an expensive and controversial process. Congressional districts (CDs) are redrawn due to changes in population reflected by the decennial census to ensure equal representation. Laws and regulations literature identifies eight criteria that may be considered when determining the boundaries of CDs and this article focuses on one of those criteria, maintaining communities of interest (COIs). This criterion requires states to preserve these boundaries when delineating CDs but fails to define a COI. This research proposes and evaluates two approaches to define a COI and examines the extent to which this criterion has been adhered to. One definition uses Thiessen polygons and census designated places to delineate COIs based on known cultural places, whereas the other definition uses cluster analysis to group together people with similar sociodemographic characteristics. The results show that the two definitions are feasible for defining a COI. Furthermore, the states largely maintain the COI boundaries within their CDs by only splitting, at most, 17.1 percent of the COIs defined. Existing literature shows that maintaining COIs within CDs leads to higher voter participation and engagement, as well as better representation. The results show that if either definition was adopted, states could comply with this criterion with relative ease. Furthermore, a standard definition could help reduce the cost and controversy surrounding the redistricting process.},

Much social capital-based research takes Robert Putnam's theorization of the subject as its starting point. Putnam's work argues that social capital can be measured by a region's levels of trust and civic engagement. While its use, and conceptualization, has undergone much academic debate, often formal institutions still employ this very narrow, and arguably Western-centric, reading of the subject. This paper argues that while at the micro-level social capital has little to do with the civic engagement and trust theories posited by Putnam. it still has relevance to the lives of marginalized individuals and is an important factor in their continued survival. To explore this, drawing on extensive qualitative research conducted in Magadan, Moscow and St Petersburg, I critically examine the construction of everyday survival strategies among Gulag survivors living in Russia's far northeast city of Magadan. Denied a return to their 'homeland' upon their release, this group experienced considerable marginalization in the post-Stalin period. This was exacerbated when the collapse of the Soviet Union saw pensions in the far northeast of Russia fall to below 50\% of the state-set subsistence minimum. The paper demonstrates the importance of social capital to this group by showing how their survival is based on far more than interactions with formal and informal organizations.},

Yet there are concerns that parents simply choose schools based on socio-demographic characteristics, thus leading to greater social segregation and undercutting the potential of choice to drive quality improvements. In this paper, we explore segregation by examining catchment areas for a range of public high schools in a specific middle-class urban area. We focus on socio-demographic characteristics, including levels of income, country of birth and religion affiliation, in order to explore residential segregation according to public high school catchment areas. Our data suggest distinct residential segregation between catchment areas for each public school within our data-set, particularly for the schools deemed to be popular and rejected, that may pose risks for broader equity concerns. We argue that, in contrast to market theory, even more affluent and active choosers are not equipped with information on the programmatic quality of their different school options, but instead may be relying on socio-demographic characteristics of schools{\textendash}through surrogate information about the urban spaces that the schools occupy{\textendash}in order to choose peer groups, if not programmes, for their children.},

Suite {\`a} l'analyse d'entretiens tir{\'e}s de contacts aupr{\`e}s d'une centaine de communaut{\'e}s et d{\'e}cideurs politiques pr{\'e}pond{\'e}rants, les auteurs ont d'abord con{\c c}u une typologie des approches des id{\'e}es li{\'e}es aux villes cr{\'e}atives~: action concert{\'e}e, engagement et mouvement strat{\'e}gique. Est ensuite {\'e}tudi{\'e} comment le concept de ville cr{\'e}ative procure un outil d'organisation {\`a} la fois critiqu{\'e} et solide qui {\'e}claire les strat{\'e}gies locales par rapport {\`a} la prosp{\'e}rit{\'e}. Une s{\'e}rie de cons{\'e}quences connexes est mise en {\'e}vidence autour de quatre enjeux essentiels~: projets artistiques et gentrification; accessibilit{\'e} financi{\`e}re au logement; tendances revanchistes {\`a} la gestion de l'espace public; et cadences relatives de l'investissement social. Il en ressort que le discours sur le potentiel social universel associ{\'e} aux id{\'e}es de ville cr{\'e}ative n{\'e}glige toujours ceux qui ne sont pas en mesure de prendre part {\`a} cette nouvelle {\'e}conomie, ainsi que ceux qui sont plus activement exclus.},

The new approach, known as differential privacy, represents a radical departure from current practice. In its pure form, differential privacy techniques may make the release of useful microdata impossible and limit the utility of tabular small-area data. Adoption of differential privacy will have far-reaching consequences for research. It is likely that scientists, planners, and the public will lose the free access we have enjoyed for six decades to reliable public Census Bureau data describing US social and economic change.},

  abstract = {The Census Bureau plans a new approach to disclosure control for the 2020 census that will add noise to every statistic the agency produces for places below the state level. The Bureau argues the new approach is needed because the confidentiality of census responses is threatened by ``database reconstruction,'' a technique for inferring individual-level responses from tabular data. The Census Bureau constructed hypothetical individual-level census responses from public 2010 tabular data and matched them to internal census records and to outside sources. The Census Bureau did not compare these results to a null model to demonstrate that their success in matching would not be expected by chance. This is analogous to conducting a clinical trial without a control group. We implement a simple simulation to assess how many matches would be expected by chance. We demonstrate that most matches reported by the Census Bureau experiment would be expected randomly. To extend the metaphor of the clinical trial, the treatment and the placebo produced similar outcomes. The database reconstruction experiment therefore fails to demonstrate a credible threat to confidentiality.},

The concentration of income extremes is persistent among neighborhoods, generally, but mixed middle-income neighborhoods are more fluid. Persistence also dominates among individuals, though Latino-Americans are much more likely than African Americans or whites to be exposed to mixed middle-income neighborhoods in the first place and to transition into them over time, even when adjusting for immigrant status, education, income, and residential mobility. The results here enhance our knowledge of the dynamics of income inequality at the neighborhood level, and the endurance of concentrated extremes suggests that policies seeking to promote mixed-income neighborhoods face greater odds than commonly thought.},

  abstract = {American cities today are simultaneously the same and different from Wilson's classic portrayal in The Truly Disadvantaged ([1987] 2012), first published over 30 years ago. Concentrated poverty and racial segregation endure, as do racial gaps in multiple aspects of wellbeing. But mass incarceration, the dramatic drop in violent crime, immigration, rising income segregation, the suburbanisation of poverty, and other macrosocial trends have transformed the urban scene. The paradoxical result is that cities today are both better and worse off. In this paper, I put forth a unifying framework on persistence and change in urban inequality, highlighting a theory of neighbourhood effects and the higher-order structure of the contemporary metropolis. I apply this analytic framework to examine: (1) neighbourhood inequality as an important driver and mediator of urban transformation; (2) racial disparities across the life course in compounded deprivation, poisoned development, and intergenerational mobility; and (3)...},

Studies of housing segregation suggest that small differences in the preferences of particular race or socio- economic groups have the potential to produce large-scale patterns of segregation. In this study, I raise three questions regarding the link between individual choice and educational segregation: rst, are the school choices of higher status families driven by a desire to avoid schools populated by students they consider to be of lower race or class status? Second, can other school features, such as safety, appearance, and educational quality, explain apparent race- or class-based choices? Third, can families' choices of schools be linked directly with seg- regation patterns independent of school district policies that may interfere with (or galvanize) the ability of people to exercise their choices? To answer these questions, I analyze magnet school application data from a large city to explore the choices of families for schools that vary in racial and economic composition. Findings show that white families avoid schools with higher percentages of non-white students. The tendency of white families to avoid schools with higher percentages of non-whites cannot be accounted for by other school characteristics such as test scores, safety, or poverty rates. I also nd that wealthier families avoid schools with higher poverty rates. The choices of white and wealthier students lead to increased racial and economic segregation in the neighbor- hood schools that these students leave. Moreover, the link between choice and segregation cannot be explained by school district policies. Findings suggest that laissez faire school choice policies, which allow the unfettered move- ment of children in and out of schools, may further deteriorate the educational conditions for disadvantaged students left behind in local public schools.},

The authors examine this issue by comparing the actual racial composition of schools with the racial composition of school-aged children living in the corresponding attendance areas. They do so by linking maps of school attendance boundaries with 2000 census data, the Common Core of Data, and the Private School Survey for the 22 largest U.S. school districts. The results show that public schools would be less racially segregated if all children living in a school district attended their neighborhood schools. In addition, private, magnet, and charter schools contribute to overall racial segregation within many school districts. The effects are particularly striking for segregation between white and Hispanic children. Finally, a few school districts with desegregation policies have succeeded in reducing racial segregation. The analyses contribute to debates regarding recent proposals to eliminate desegregation programs while simultaneously expanding "free-market" educational reforms that promote students' mobility across public, private, and charter schools.},

  abstract = {This research investigates if and how much the shapes of school attendance zones contribute to racial segregation in schools. We find that the typical school attendance zone is relatively compact and resembles a square-like shape. Compact zones typically draw children from local residential areas, and since local areas are often racially homogeneous, this suggests that high levels of racial segregation in the largest school districts are largely structured by existing residential segregation. Still, this study finds that the United States contains some attendance zones with highly irregular shapes-some of which are as irregular as the most irregular Congressional District. Although relatively rare, attendance zones that are highly irregular in shape almost always contain racially diverse student populations. This racial diversity contributes to racial integration within school districts. These findings contradict recent theoretical and empirical scholarship arguing that irregularly shaped zones contribute to racial segregation in schools. Our findings suggest that most racial segregation in school attendance zones is driven by large-scale segregation across residential areas rather than a widespread practice among school districts to exacerbate racial segregation by delineating irregularly shaped attendance zones.},

Based on an analysis of 304 school districts, findings show that more irregularly-shaped school attendance zones are correlated with lower levels of racial segregation in attendance zones after accounting for residential segregation. In fact, not one school district contains both highly irregularly-shaped attendance zones and unusually high levels of attendance zone racial segregation{\textemdash}although there are several school districts with irregularly-shaped zones and unusually high levels of racial integration. These findings undermine recent claims that irregularly-shaped attendance zones generally serve to segregate students by race. In addition to these empirical findings, this paper introduces a variation of the spatial information theory segregation index H{\texttildelow} that is useful for predicting segregation in school attendance zones and other types of geographic boundaries containing roughly equal populations.},

  abstract = {This paper examines individual and aggregate data to document the growing political diversity in rural America. This political diversity is evident in the various economies within rural America. The new rural economy is reflected in recreational counties, where natural and built amenities combined with the provision of services to residents and visitors are the basis for the local economy. Residents of recreational counties tend to be more liberal than their rural peers on a variety of political issues, and supported Barack Obama at significantly higher levels in 2008 and 2012. In contrast, in regions dominated by the old rural economy of farming, political views are more conservative and there is far less support for Democrats in general and President Obama in particular. An analysis of survey data combined with multivariate spatial regression analysis demonstrates that these differences between the old and new rural economy persist even when a variety of demographic, economic, social and geographic variables are controlled.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the growing political divide in the United States and how ideological polarization has increasingly assumed spatial dimensions, as rural areas have become strongly associated with Republican support, and urban areas have become associated with strong Democratic support. In the context of the recent Trump administration, marked not only by authoritarian tendencies, ethno-n\- ationalism, and hostility towards democratic institutions, but its denouement represented by the U.S. Capitol insurrection on January 6th, 2021 and the weeks that followed, what are the implications for growing spatialized civic and political divides, and indeed for democracy itself? I discuss several main approaches taken by social scientists to explain the relationship between spatial and political divides in the United States, including those that focus on shifting political geographies, cultural factors, economic anxiety, and racial resentment. Then, pointing to several recent exemplars, I identify theoretical, methodological, and perspectival strengths that the discipline of rural sociology can and should engage in developing explanatory frameworks for better understanding these social and spatial shifts {\textendash}\-shifts that are simultaneously crises of democracy and crises of epistemology.},

  abstract = {Purpose We examined the geographic bias of four methods of geocoding addresses using ArcGIS, commercial firm, SAS/GIS, and aerial photography. We compared ``point-in-polygon'' (ArcGIS, commercial firm, and aerial photography) and the ``look-up table'' method (SAS/GIS) to allocate addresses to census geography, particularly as it relates to census-based poverty rates. Methods We randomly selected 299 addresses of children treated for asthma at an urban emergency department (1999{\textendash}2001). The coordinates of the building address side door were obtained by constant offset based on ArcGIS and a commercial firm and true ground location based on aerial photography. Results Coordinates were available for 261 addresses across all methods. For 24\% to 30\% of geocoded road/door coordinates the positional error was 51 meters or greater, which was similar across geocoding methods. The mean bearing was -26.8 degrees for the vector of coordinates based on aerial photography and ArcGIS and 8.5 degrees for the vector based on aerial photography and the commercial firm (p {$<$} 0.0001). ArcGIS and the commercial firm performed very well relative to SAS/GIS in terms of allocation to census geography. For 20\%, the door location based on aerial photography was assigned to a different block group compared to SAS/GIS. The block group poverty rate varied at least two standard deviations for 6\% to 7\% of addresses. Conclusion We found important differences in distance and bearing between geocoding relative to aerial photography. Allocation of locations based on aerial photography to census-based geographic areas could lead to substantial errors.},

  abstract = {In recent years, local officials throughout the United States have attempted to retool workforce development programs that have historically been tied to federal antipoverty efforts to address the needs of employers in industries considered important for local economic development. But are these old and new goals for workforce development reconcilable? Does a more employer- and industry-focused approach affects the ability of policymakers and practitioners to address the problems of low-wage labor markets? This article examines a recent initiative in Chicago to establish sector-based workforce centers in the manufacturing and service industries. This case study finds that efforts to "rework" the public workforce development system to meet the needs of employers can be at odds with efforts to meet the needs of disadvantaged populations. But greater proximity to employers can also enhance the system's capacity to promote more progressive human resource practices and equitable labor market outcomes.},

  abstract = {Areal interpolation transforms data for a variable of interest from a set of source zones to estimate the same variable's distribution over a set of target zones. One common practice has been to guide interpolation by using ancillary control zones that are related to the variable of interest's spatial distribution. This guidance typically involves using source zone data to estimate the density of the variable of interest within each control zone. This article introduces a novel approach to density estimation, the geographically weighted expectation{\textendash}maximization (GWEM), which combines features of two previously used techniques, the expectation{\textendash}maximization (EM) algorithm and geographically weighted regression. The EM algorithm provides a framework for incorporating proper constraints on data distributions, and using geographical weighting allows estimated control-zone density ratios to vary spatially. We assess the accuracy of GWEM by applying it with land use/land cover (LULC) ancillary data to population counts from a nationwide sample of 1980 U.S. census tract pairs. We find that GWEM generally is more accurate in this setting than several previously studied methods. Because target-density weighting (TDW){\textemdash}using 1970 tract densities to guide interpolation{\textemdash}outperforms GWEM in many cases, we also consider two GWEM{\textendash}TDW hybrid approaches and find them to improve estimates substantially. 区域插值可通过变换一组源区感兴趣变量的数据得到目标区域同一变量的分布。采用与感兴趣变量空间分布密切相关的辅助控制区来引导插值是最常用的一种方法，通常涉及采用源区域数据估计每个控制区内感兴趣变量的密度值。本文引入了地理加权最大期望算法（GWEM）来进行密度估计，综合了过去常用的最大期望算法（EM）和地理加权回归（GWR）两种技术特征。EM算法为数据分布约束的集成提供框架，地理加权则允许估计估计控制区密度比例的空间变异。以美国1980年全国普查区域的土地利用/土地覆被数据种群统计为例，对该方法的精度进行了评估。结果显示，GWEM比多种现有方法准确性更高。采用目标密度加权法（TDW）以1970年束密度来进行插值在许多情况下优于GWEM，融合GWEM-TDW两种方法可大幅改善估计结果。},

  abstract = {To measure population changes in areas where census unit boundaries do not align across time, a common approach is to interpolate data from one census's units to another's. This article presents a broad assessment of areal interpolation models for estimating counts of 2000 characteristics in 2010 census units throughout the United States. We interpolate from 2000 census block data using 4 types of ancillary data to guide interpolation: 2010 block densities, imperviousness data, road buffers, and water body polygons. We test 8 binary dasymetric (BD) models and 8 target-density weighting (TDW) models, each using a unique combination of the 4 ancillary data types, and derive 2 hybrid models that blend the best-performing BD and TDW models. The most accurate model is a hybrid that generally gives high weight to TDW (allocating 2000 data in proportion to 2010 densities) but gives increasing weight to a BD model (allocating data uniformly within developed land near roads) in proportion to the estimated 2000{\textendash}2010 rate of change within each block. Although for most 2010 census units, this hybrid model's estimates differ little from the simplest model's estimates, there are still many areas where the estimates differ considerably. Estimates from the final model, along with lower and upper bounds for each estimate, are publicly available for over 1000 population and housing characteristics at 10 geographic levels via the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS {\textendash} http://nhgis.org).},

To protect privacy, the Census Bureau restricts the detail of geographic information in public use microdata, and this complicates how researchers can investigate and account for variations across levels of urbanization when analyzing microdata. One option is to focus on metropolitan status, which can be determined exactly for most microdata records and approximated for others, but a binary metro/nonmetro classification is still coarse and limited on its own, emphasizing one aspect of rural{\textendash}urban variation and discounting others. To address these issues, we compute two continuous indices for public use microdata{\textemdash}average tract density and average metro/micro-area population{\textemdash}using population-weighted geometric means. We show how these indices correspond to two key dimensions of urbanization{\textemdash}concentration and size{\textemdash}and we demonstrate their utility through an examination of disparities in poverty throughout the rural{\textendash}urban universe. Poverty rates vary across settlement types in nonlinear ways: rates are lowest in moderately dense parts of major metro areas, and rates are higher in both low- and high-density areas, as well as in smaller commuting systems. Using the two indices also reveals that correlations between poverty and demographic characteristics vary considerably across settlement types. Both indices are now available for recent census microdata via IPUMS USA (               https://usa.ipums.org                           ).},

Such an approach increases the recognition of both potential inference problems in individual-level studies and the unique contributions of ecological variables.

Why do well-intentioned plans for improving the human condition go tragically awry? In this wide-ranging and original book, James C. Scott analyzes failed cases of large-scale authoritarian plans in a variety of fields. Centrally managed social plans misfire, Scott argues, when they impose schematic visions that do violence to complex interdependencies that are not{\textemdash}and cannot{\textemdash}be fully understood. Further, the success of designs for social organization depends upon the recognition that local, practical knowledge is as important as formal, epistemic knowledge. The author builds a persuasive case against "development theory" and imperialistic state planning that disregards the values, desires, and objections of its subjects. He identifies and discusses four conditions common to all planning disasters: administrative ordering of nature and society by the state; a "high-modernist ideology" that places confidence in the ability of science to improve every aspect of human life; a willingness to use authoritarian state power to effect large- scale interventions; and a prostrate civil society that cannot effectively resist such plans.},

As such, regions are an essential dimension of the development process, not just in the more advanced countries but also in less-developed parts of the world. Development theorists have hitherto largely tended to overlook this critical issue in favour of an emphasis on macroeconomic considerations. At the same time, conventional theories of the relationship between urbanization and economic development have favoured the view that the former is simply an effect of the latter. To be fully general, the theory of development must incorporate the role of cities and regions as active and causal elements in the economic growth process. This argument has consequences for development policy, especially in regard to the promotion of positive agglomeration economies and the initiation of growth in poorer regions. A related policy problem concerns ways of dealing with the increase in interregional inequalities associated with contemporary globalization. Issues of economic geography are thus of major significance to development theory and practice.},

Most environmental epidemiology studies assign the home address exposure to the study subjects. Here, we quantify the exposure estimation error at the population scale due to assigning it solely at the residence place. A cohort of most schoolchildren in Israel ({\textasciitilde}~950,000), age 6{\textendash}18, and a representative cohort of Israeli adults ({\textasciitilde}~380,000), age 24{\textendash}65, were used. For each subject the home and the work or school addresses were geocoded. Together, these two microenvironments account for the locations at which people are present during most of the weekdays. For each subject, we estimated ambient nitrogen oxide concentrations at the home and work or school addresses using two air quality models: a stationary land use regression model and a dynamic dispersion-like model. On average, accounting for the subjects' work or school address as well as for the daily pollutant variation reduced the estimation error of exposure to ambient NOx/NO2 by 5{\textendash}10~ppb, since daytime concentrations at work/school and at home can differ significantly. These results were consistent regardless which air quality model as used and even for subjects that work or study close to their home. Yet, due to their usually short commute, assigning schoolchildren exposure solely at their residential place seems to be a reasonable estimation. In contrast, since adults commute for longer distances, assigning exposure of adults only at the residential place has a lower correlation with the daily weighted exposure, resulting in larger exposure estimation errors. We show that exposure misclassification can result from not accounting for the subjects' time-location trajectories through the spatiotemporally varying pollutant concentrations field.},

Socio-economic characteristics are associated with activity patterns, as well as with the quality of places where certain groups conduct activities, i.e. their non-residential activity space. Examining how measures of exposure to resources, and inequalities thereof, compare between residential and non-residential contexts is required. Baseline data from 1890 young adults (18-25 years-old) participating in the Interdisciplinary Study of Inequalities in Smoking, Montreal, Canada (2011-2012), were analyzed. Socio-demographic and activity location data were collected using a validated, self-administered questionnaire. Area-level material deprivation was measured within 500-mroad-network buffer zones around participants' residential and activity locations. Deprivation scores in the residential area and non-residential activity space were compared between social groups. Multivariate linear regression was used to estimate associations between individual- and area-level characteristics and non-residential activity space deprivation, and to explore whether these characteristics attenuated the education-deprivation association. Participants in low educational categories lived and conducted activities in more disadvantaged areas than university students/graduates. Educational inequalities in exposure to area-level deprivation were larger in the non-residential activity space than in the residential area for the least educated, but smaller for the intermediate group. Adjusting for selected covariates such as transportation resources and residential deprivation did not significantly attenuate the education-deprivation associations. Results support the existence of social isolation in residential areas and activity locations, whereby less educated individuals tend to be confined to more disadvantaged areas than their more educated counterparts. They also highlight the relevance of investigating both residential and non-residential contexts when studying inequalities in health-relevant exposures. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Building on recent research showing strong continuity in neighborhood environments across generations of family members, the authors argue for a revised perspective on "neighborhood effects" that considers the ways in which the neighborhood environment in one generation may have a lingering impact on the next generation. To analyze multigenerational effects, the authors use newly developed methods designed to estimate unbiased treatment effects when treatments and confounders vary over time. The results confirm a powerful link between neighborhoods and cognitive ability that extends across generations. A family's exposure to neighborhood poverty across two consecutive generations reduces child cognitive ability by more than half a standard deviation. A formal sensitivity analysis suggests that results are robust to unobserved selection bias.},

The findings show that there has been no change over time in the degree to which majority- black neighborhoods are surrounded by spatial disadvantage.

However, there has been substantial change in the degree to which middle- and upper-income African-American households have sepa- rated themselves from highly disadvantaged neighborhoods. These changes are driven primarily by the growing segment of middle- and upper-income African-Americans living in neighborhoods in which they are not the majority group, both in central cities and in suburbs.

Using this information along with the extensive geographic information available in the PSID survey, the article tracks the geographic locations of four generations of family members and considers the ways in which families and places are linked together over the course of a family's history. The patterns documented in the article are consistent with much of the demographic literature on the Great Migration of black Americans out of the South, but they reveal new insights into patterns of black migration after the Great Migration. In the most recent generation, black Americans have remained in place to a degree that is unique relative to the previous generation and relative to whites of the same generation. This new geographic immobility is the most pronounced change in black Americans' migration patterns after the Great Migration, and it is a pattern that has implications for the demography of black migration as well as the literature on racial inequality.},

  abstract = {Neighborhoods have long held a central place in the analysis and planning of urban spaces. Despite this centrality, the exact definition of a neighborhood, as well as how and where to draw its boundaries, has remained unclear. And while these questions have generated significant academic debate, they have arguably little effect on people's everyday lives or decision-making processes. Atlanta, Georgia represents a different case, however, because of the city's system of `neighborhood planning units' (NPU), which has shaped the city's planning and political processes since the mid- 1970s. But despite significant changes within the city's intra-urban geography since the 1970s, the geography of the NPU system has remained largely unchanged. As such, this paper attempts to harness the potentials of big data to rethink the nature and geographies of Atlanta's neighborhoods. Drawing on archival documents, historic maps of the city's neighborhoods and new sources of big data, this paper explores the evolution of Atlanta's neighborhoods from the 1960s up to the present day. In particular, our analysis highlights the fundamentally fuzzy, fluid and relational nature of neighborhoods, both in the ways neighborhoods are defined by political and administrative entities and through the everyday lives of residents. Ultimately, this work calls into question the idea of the neighborhood as a natural, pre-existing, discrete and static spatial unit, and points to the utility of using new sources of data and analytical techniques for revealing this underlying relationality.},

At the nationail/regional operation of these programmes groups of people who are not participating are often identified as 'socially excluded groups'. This article contends that rural development programmes are misinterpreting the social processes of participation and consequently labelling some groups as socially excluded when they are not. This is partly because of the interchangeable and confused use of the concepts social inclusion, social capital and civic engagement, and partly because of the presumption that to participate is the default position. Three groups identified as socially excluded groups in Northern Ireland are considered. It is argued that a more careful analysis of what social inclusion means, what civic engagement means, and why participation is presumed to be the norm, leads to a different conclusion about who is excluded. This has both theoretical and policy relevance for the much used concept of social inclusion. (C) 2008 Elsevier. Ltd. All rights reserved.},

As expanding student populations stretch the enrollment capacities of existing schools in suburban communities, new schools are built and attendance lines are redrawn. This redistricting process can be used either to foster school diversity or to exacerbate racial isolation. Drawing on data from the U.S. Census, the National Center for Eucation Statistics (NCES), and the school district, along with mapping software from Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Siegel-Hawley examines the relationship between overcrowding, racial isolation, and the original, proposed, and final high school attendance zones in a changing suburban district. Findings indicate that school officials responsible for the rezoning process failed to embrace the growing diversity of the school system, choosing instead to solidify extreme patterns of racial isolation within high school attendance areas. The segregative impact of the district's new attendance zones may be subject to legal scrutiny, a consequence that could-and should-discourage other school systems fom adopting similar redistricting policies.},

Decades removed from the Civil Rights Movement, during a period of stark inequality, colorblind law and policymaking, and a diminished understanding of education as a societal benefit, the central suburban rationale for secession, local control, carries new weight. It gives already privileged communities a race-neutral, legally sanctioned, and politically persuasive way to discuss resource accumulation that maps onto existing racial and economic segregation. Memphis-area lessons offer insight into an increasing number of secession struggles and enrich our understanding of how educational advantage is consolidated in the 21st-century metropolis.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present an agent-based model of a human population, designed to illustrate the potential synergies between demography and agent-based social simulation. In the modelling process, we take advantage of the perspectives of both disciplines: demography being more focused on matching statistical models to empirical data, and social simulation on explanations of social mechanisms underlying the observed phenomena. This work is based on earlier attempts to introduce agent-based modelling to demography, but extends them into a multi-level and multi-state framework. We illustrate our approach with a proof-of-concept model of partnership formation and changing health status over the life course. In addition to the agent-based component, the model includes empirical elements based on demographic data for the United Kingdom. As such, the model allows analysis of the demographic dynamics at a variety of levels, from the individual, through the household, to the whole population. We bolster this analysis further by using statistical emulation techniques, which allow for in-depth investigation of the interaction of model parameters and of the resulting output uncertainty. We argue that the approach although not fully predictive per se has four important advantages. first, the model is capable of studying the linked lives of simulated individuals in a variety of scenarios. second, the simulations can be readily embedded in the relevant social or physical spaces. third, the approach allows for overcoming some data-related limitations, augmenting the available statistical information with assumptions on behavioural rules. fourth, statistical emulators enable exploration of the parameter space of the underlying agent-based models.},

Our research integrates the embeddedness and trust literatures to explain variation in within-network exchanges based on an interaction of the purchaser's generalized trust and the level of uncertainty entailed in the purchase (i.e., whether there exists an incentive for the seller to misrepresent the quality of some good or service). For purchases involving uncertainty, low-trusters will tend to forgo risky transactions with strangers, opting instead for the increased certainty of embedded markets. High-trusters, on the other hand, will be more likely to transact with strangers (despite the increased risk), from whom they can often find better deals. We should not expect any differences between high- and low-trusters for products that do not entail uncertainty.

In fact, gentrification is an expected product of the relatively unhampered operation of the land and housing markets. The economic depreciation of capital invested in nineteenth century inner-city neighborhoods and the simultaneous rise in potential ground rent levels produces the possibility of profitable redevelopment. Although the very apparent social characteristics of deteriorated neighborhoods would discourage redevelopment, the hidden economic characteristics may well be favorable. Whether gentrification is a fundamental restructuring of urban space depends not on where new inhabitants come from but on how much productive capital returns to the area from the suburbs.},

  abstract = {Simulation models are increasingly used in applied research to create synthetic micropopulations and predict possible individual-level outcomes of policy intervention. Previous research highlights the relevance of simulation techniques in estimating the potential outcomes of changes in areas such as taxation and child benefit policy, crime, education, or health inequalities. To date, however, there is very little published research on the creation, calibration, and testing of such micropopulations and models, and little on the issue of how well synthetic data can fit locally as opposed to globally in such models. This paper discusses the process of improving the process of synthetic micropopulation generation with the aim of improving and extending existing spatial microsimulation models. Experiments using different variable configurations to constrain the models are undertaken with the emphasis on producing a suite of models to match the different sociodemographic conditions found within a typical city. The results show that creating processes to generate area-specific synthetic populations, which reflect the diverse populations within the study area, provides more accurate population estimates for future policy work than the traditional global model configurations.},

Responding to public health officials' need for data on relatively homogeneous units, the Census Bureau began tabulating data on subdivisions of a few cities in the 1890s. When social workers and business organizations joined public health officers in asking the Census Bureau for such data, the agency agreed to publish data based on their delineation of census tracts. To meet growing demand from marketers and government planners, the Census Bureau added data on census blocks in 1940 and later on other geographic entities aggregated from blocks. Since the 1970s, the need for small area data for legislative redistricting pushed the agency to extend nationwide the areas for which it provided small area data. The most recent evolution has arisen out of calls for more timely data. The American Community Survey in 2010 replaced the decennial long-form and began delivering small area data more than once a decade.},

This comparison was made possible by using geographic information systems (GIS) to link maps of elementary, middle, and high school attendance boundaries with 2000 census data, the Common Core of Data, and the Private School Survey for the 22 largest school districts. Results show that public schools would be less racially segregated if all children living in a school district attended their local, neighborhood schools. Similarly, findings reveal that private, magnet, and charter schools contribute to overall racial segregation within most school districts. Finally, while segregation levels in school catchment areas become lower from elementary to middle to high schools, the difference in segregation between catchment areas and the schools that serve them remains constant across all levels.},

Human capital spillovers within an ethnic community can increase the self-employment propensity of its members by decreasing the costs associated with starting and running a business (especially, transaction costs and information costs). Immigrants who do not speak English and those with little formal education are more likely to be self-employed if they reside in an ethnic community boasting higher human capital. On the other hand, the educational attainment of co-ethnics does not appear to affect the self-employment choices of immigrants with a post-secondary education to become self-employed. Further analysis suggests that immigrants in communities with more human capital choose industries that are more capital-intensive. Overall, the results suggest that the communities in which immigrants reside influences their self-employment decisions. For low-skilled immigrants who face high costs to learning English and/or acquiring more education, these human capital spillovers may serve as an alternative resource of information and labor mobility.},

Results from hierarchical linear models show that about 20\% to 40\% of the variation in the percentage of households' tract population that is nonHispanic white or non-Hispanic black exists across metropolitan areas. Over time, white households' exposure to non-Hispanic white neighbors has declined, and their exposure to non-Hispanic black neighbors has increased; the reverse trends are observed for blacks. These trends cannot be attributed to changes in the ecological structure of metropolitan areas. Blacks have fewer white neighbors in large metropolitan areas containing sizable minority populations, and blacks have more white neighbors in metropolitan areas with high government employment. Whites have more black neighbors in metropolitan areas with high levels of government employment and ample new housing; whites have fewer black neighbors in metropolitan areas with a high level of municipal fragmentation. The association between metropolitan-area percentage black and tract percentage black is weaker among whites than among blacks, suggesting that whites are especially motivated to self-segregate in metropolitan areas with large black populations.},

Applied research on the link between the environment and health remains limited by the way spatial concepts, such as "the neighborhood" or "the built environment" are operationalized. In this paper we argue that representations of these spatial concepts in statistical models should be based upon the individuals, the place, and the problem under study. Through a series of simulation experiments we describe the sensitivity of estimates of the association between neighborhoods and health to the operationalization of spatial concepts. We explore the practice of conducting the same analysis at multiple scales and find that using model fit to "discover" the spatial dimension is problematic. In sum, there is a gap between our understanding of how the environment influences health and spatial statistical modeling techniques. For quantitative spatial inquiry into the relationship between the neighborhood environment and health to be effective this gap must be closed.},

We conceptualize a neighborhood in terms of both space and social composition; it is a contiguous territory defined by a bundle of social attributes that distinguish it from surrounding areas. Our method does not impose either a specific social characteristic or a predetermined spatial scale to define a neighborhood. Rather we infer neighborhoods from detailed information about individual residents and their locations. The analysis is based on geocoded complete-count census data from the late 19(th) Century in four cities: Albany, NY, Buffalo, NY, Cincinnati, OH, and Newark, NJ. We find striking regularities (and some anomalies) in the spatial structure of the cities studied. Our approach illustrates the "spatialization" of an important social scientific concept.},

These small area estimates suffer from large margins of error, however, which makes the data difficult to use for many purposes. The value of a large and comprehensive survey like the ACS is that it provides a richly detailed, multivariate, composite picture of small areas. This article argues that one solution to the problem of large margins of error in the ACS is to shift from a variable-based mode of inquiry to one that emphasizes a composite multivariate picture of census tracts. Because the margin of error in a single ACS estimate, like household income, is assumed to be a symmetrically distributed random variable, positive and negative errors are equally likely. Because the variable-specific estimates are largely independent from each other, when looking at a large collection of variables these random...},

We argue that microscale space{\textendash}time paths fail to account for contextual determinants of behavior, because they emphasize ``contacts'' over ``contexts,'' a problem that could be solved, in part, by using a broader ``generalized'' representation of geographic context. This article develops the idea of a generalized activity space and empirically tests the viability of the concept. Support for the viability of the idea is identified through analysis of 34,500 trips by 7,550 individuals in Atlanta. We find that demographic characteristics and residential location jointly shape a person's geographic context. Through a series of hypothesis tests, we find evidence that these location{\textendash}demographic groupings are generalizable; that is, people with similar socioeconomic backgrounds and residential locations exhibit similar generalized activity spaces. Residential location, by itself, however, is not an effective descriptor of the configuration of a person's context. We argue that generalized activity spaces have potential to inform study of how the environment influences behavior by allowing a more robust consideration of interplay between socioeconomic characteristics and the use of space.},

  abstract = {Objectives Sociologists and other scholars have debated the causes of continuing residential segregation for several decades. Social class has been largely discounted as a substantial determinant of residential segregation by race, but recent studies have brought renewed attention to class variables. The present study reassesses the role of social class, using household income, while also considering metropolitan area characteristics. Methods This study expands on prior research by examining residential segregation between black-alone and white-alone households with 2000 decennial Census data for all U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) with at least 200,000 or more black population or 1,000,000 total population (60 MSAs total), using both spatial unevenness (dissimilarity) and two types of experiential (i.e., contextual) indicators (exposure indices), measuring socioeconomic status (SES) with a greater range and number of income levels than in past research, and using multivariate models to account for metropolitan area characteristics. Results We find that both dissimilarity and exposure measures are significantly associated with household income-black households with higher household incomes live in neighborhoods with greater exposure to whites and lower isolation from other blacks than do black households with lower incomes. Additionally, a number of MSA-level characteristics-several of which have not been considered in previous research-are substantially associated with black/white residential segregation. Conclusion We interpret these findings in the context of spatial assimilation and place stratification perspectives, and conclude that racial segregation is at least partly based on class.

I argue that community is a "problem" not because it is inherently "bad", but rather, because it is a site where contests are waged over citizenship and the terms of membership in society. Community is, therefore, the object of struggle in which different moral geographies are imagined. The entry point into this discussion is a recognition that community is constituted by contradictions that operate simultaneously. As such, community is the terrain that is negotiated as particular constructions of citizenship are put forward. It is not, however, a settled terrain, as theories and experiences of citizenship and community are always in competition, being constituted as they are by different rationalities, moral values, and imaginations of what is possible.

We find that segregation is consistently associated with lower levels of educational attainment and labor market success for both African American and Latino young adults compared with whites, with associations of similar magnitudes for both groups. One mechanism through which segregation may influence outcomes is the difference in the levels of neighborhood human capital to which whites, Latinos, and African Americans are exposed. We find that higher levels of segregation are associated with lower black and Latino neighborhood exposure to residents with college degrees, relative to whites. We also find support for other commonly discussed mechanisms, such as exposure to neighborhood violent crime and the relative proficiency of the closest public school.},

  abstract = {Quantifying human exposure to air pollutants is a challenging task. Ambient concentrations of air pollutants at potentially harmful levels are ubiquitous in urban areas and subject to high spatial and temporal variability. At the same time, every individual has unique activity-patterns. Exposure results from multifaceted relationships and interactions between environmental and human systems, adding complexity to the assessment process. Traditionally, approaches to quantify human exposure have relied on pollutant concentrations from fixed air quality network sites and static population distributions. New developments in sensor technology now enable us to monitor personal exposure to air pollutants directly while people are moving through their activity spaces and varying concentration fields. The literature review on which this paper is based on reflects recent developments in the assessment of human exposure to air pollution. This includes the discussion of methodologies and concepts, and the elaboration of approaches and study designs applied in the field. We identify shortcomings of current approaches and discuss future research needs. We close by proposing a novel conceptual model for the integrated assessment of human exposure to air pollutants taking into account latest technological capabilities and contextual information. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Much of this work has sought either to introduce new measures of gerrymandering or to analyze a metric{\textemdash}the efficiency gap{\textemdash}that we previously developed. In this Essay, we reframe the debate by presenting a series of criteria that can be used to evaluate gerrymandering metrics: (1) consistency with the efficiency principle; (2) distinctness from other electoral values; (3) breadth of scope; and (4) correspondence with U.S. electoral history. We then apply these criteria to both the efficiency gap and other measures. The efficiency gap complies with our criteria under all circumstances. Other metrics, in contrast, often violate the efficiency principle and cannot be used in certain electoral settings.},

This study addressed the possibility that the effects of neighborhood are due in part to exposure to community-wide stressors rather than variations in protective factors such as social capital. A questionnaire survey including a 10-item neighborhood problems scale and measures of self-reported health, health behaviors, and social capital was completed by 419 residents of 18 higher socioeconomic status (SES) neighborhoods and 235 residents of 19 lower SES neighborhoods. Data were analyzed using regression and multilevel methods. Neighborhood problem scores were greater in lower than higher SES neighborhoods, positively associated with individual deprivation, and negatively correlated with social capital. Neighborhood problems were not related to smoking, diet, alcohol consumption, or physical activity. However, neighborhood problems were associated with poor self-rated health, psychological distress on the General Health Questionnaire, and impaired physical function, independent of age, sex, neighborhood SES, individual deprivation, and social capital. Adjusted odds ratios for the highest versus lowest neighborhood problem quartiles ranged from 2.05 (confidence interval = 1.15-3.69) for poor self-rated health to 3.07 (1.63-5.79) for impaired physical function. The results provide preliminary evidence that residential neighborhood problems constitute sources of chronic stress that may increase risk of poor health.},

By examining variation in productivity growth over time and across industries and by exploring the link with IT capital, one can better understand the US productivity revival. Two specific questions are addressed. First, is the US productivity revival widespread, or is it concentrated in relatively few industries? Second, are industry productivity gains linked to IT use?},

  abstract = {The resurgence of big, old cities and their regions is real, but it is merely a part of a broader pattern of urban change in the developed countries, whose broadest tendency is urban emergence, including suburbanisation, and movements of population to certain `Sunbelt' regions. The problem is that it is difficult to accommodate explanation of both resurgence and emergence using the main explanations in the field today. These include: theories of the knowledge or creative economy, urban amenities, diversity and tolerance, and urban beauty. In most of their common specifications, they do well for either resurgent or emergent cities, but not for both at the same time. This suggests that these ideas, interesting as they are, require much greater specification and, in some cases, overhaul, in order to offer satisfactory responses to the diversity of patterns of urban growth. By examining some of these deficiencies, we conclude that urban theory needs a better understanding of urban choice behaviours and especially the effects of bundling, the limits to preference substitutions and the relationship between past and present preferences, in order to become fully effective in explaining urban resurgence and urban emergence. When these aspects of choice and preference are better integrated into urban theory, then the `exogenous' causes of urbanisation can be made more endogenous and, in addition, they can be applied better to both emergence and resurgence. Urban research can, by so doing, also potentially become more policy-relevant.},

Via a GIS-based address matching procedure, we were able to georeference individual voters (registered voters who casted their votes) and non-voters (those registered voters who did not cast their votes) for three recent local referenda in College Station, Texas. We then conducted a scale-sensitive, second-order spatial analysis for the spatial distribution of voter turn-outs, followed by a spatial clustering analysis of the voting results using Getis{\textendash}Ord's Gi statistic. We found that the extent of neighborhood effects in local elections is heavily influenced by the voter turn-out. If voter turn-out is clustered at intermediate and large scale, voting results tend to be clustered and also exhibit a sharp polarization between high and low values. If voter turn-out tends to be uniform/regular at intermediate scales but randomly distributed at both small and large scales, there appears to be less clustering in the voting results and thus lack of the neighborhood effect. If the voter turn-out pattern is mixed-uniform/regular at the small scale, random at the intermediate scale, but clustered at the large scale, the voting results show a stronger neighborhood effect.},

The ACS replaces part of the original census (long form) in the 2010 decennial Census in the U.S. Reliability of estimates should be taken into account when analyzing and mapping ACS data because these estimates are derived from surveys with sample sizes much smaller than those in the decennial censuses. Most maps using ACS data do not include data reliability information. In this article, we review the standard data quality or reliability information accompanying the ACS estimates. We propose a set of techniques to map ACS estimates by incorporating the margin of error (MOE) or related information either on the map display or in the mapping process. The techniques are proposed in two contexts: recognizing the varying degree of reliability among estimates, and determining if estimates are statistically different. They offer cartographers and GIS users some options to map ACS estimat...},

Their values might not be statistically different, however, if the data are gathered from surveys, such as the American Community Survey, in which estimates have sampling error. This article presents an approach to determine class breaks using the class separability criterion, which refers to the levels of certainty that values in different classes are statistically different from each other. Our procedure determines class breaks that offer the highest levels of separability given the desired number of classes. The separability levels of all class breaks are included in a legend design to show the statistical likelihood that values on two sides of each class break are different. The legend and the associated separability information offer map readers crucial information about the reliability of the spatial patterns that could result from the chosen classification method.},

Scholarship on neighborhood-level social make-up has most often focused on the problem of racial and economic segregation, but we believe there are important insights and lessons to be drawn from analyzing the spatial, socio-economic and temporal patterns of neighborhoods that are income-diverse. How should income diverse neighborhoods be defined and measured, and what factors are associated with them in different time periods? We explore these characterizations using tract-level census data for Chicago covering three census years: 1950, 1980, and 2010. Very few tracts were persistently diverse in all time periods, and the profile of income diverse tracts changed with each decade. In 1950, diverse tracts were dense, White, and had lower median income than non-diverse tracts. Thirty years later, diverse tracts were gentrified, but they were not different racially, nor in built form, from non-diverse tracts. By 2010, diverse tracts were back to having lower median income, but unlike in 1950, they now had fewer Whites, fewer Blacks, and far more Hispanics than non-diverse tracts.},

  abstract = {Partisan gerrymandering is widely frowned upon by the citizenry as well as the Supreme Court. Despite broad disdain for the practice, the Supreme Court has found it difficult to identify a workable standard by which we might regulate political gerrymandering. We have lacked sufficient tools to analyze and synthesize redistricting data, in part, because the requisite computation is massive. At the same time, the recent proliferation of significant computing power has led to the discovery of the extensive and often surprising reach of technology, information, and computation in many realms of life. Our capacities to compile, organize, analyze, and disseminate information have increased dramatically and facilitated the creation of many tools to connect citizens and automate human tasks. We present a computational model that brings these significantly advanced computing capacities to the redistricting process. Our model allows us to understand redistricting in fundamentally new ways and allows us to integrate technological advances with our articulated theories for redistricting and democratic rule while also empowering citizens with new abilities to understand and overturn partisan gerrymanders.},

We measure the racial and income segregation in these districts at the school level from 2000 to 2015, examining the relationship between integration methods and levels of segregation. We also measure block group-level segregation in these school districts during this time period to better understand residential patterns of segregation within the districts and contextualize school-level trends.},

This paper explores the relationship between mobility and neighbourhood change by examining income developments of in-migrants, out-migrants and non-migrants of neighbourhoods in three Dutch cities. The paper demonstrates that in- and out-migration are not the only processes at work and that changes in the socioeconomic status of non-migrants are of importance too. Within upgrading neighbourhoods, incumbent processes of non-migrants seem to be an important driver of upgrading. Furthermore, although in-migrants have relatively low incomes when moving in, they experience strong income gains in the years after in-migrating. The contribution of out-migrants to upgrading is mixed. In line with previous studies, migration reinforces downgrading processes, although at the same time, incumbent processes of non-migrants impede downgrading.},

This study focuses on changes in low-income neighborhoods as they transpire at the micro level of housing unit turnover. Using a unique panel survey of low-income neighborhoods, the study examines how characteristics of previous occupants, housing units, and neighborhoods affect the chances that units will transition into or out of poverty. Results show that although turnover rates are high, the poverty status of occupants changes infrequently. Occupant, unit, and neighborhood factors help to explain the changes that do occur. Improving low-income neighborhoods is challenging because the poverty status of occupants tends not to change, but there are aspects of the built and social environment that can affect occupancy transitions in ways that reduce poverty concentration.},

However, the most widely used measures of residential inequality merely describe the extent to which groups are nominally differentiated in residential space. I use 1980 and 1990 U.S. Census data to calculate levels of and changes in residential stratification2014the degree to which members of one group tend to live in more advantaged neighborhoods than members of another group2014between whites and blacks, Latinos, and Asians. Results both confirm and qualify conventional interpretations of residential inequality when measured as nominal2013level segregation. For example, although in 1990 Latinos and Asians were similarly and only moderately segregated from whites, Asians experienced dramatically lower levels of neighborhood disadvantage. I also find that although levels of segregation were nearly identical in central cities and suburban rings, residential stratification was much lower for suburban residents than for their central city counterparts. I conclude by discussing implications of the findings for theoretical and empirical research on residential inequality.},

The social and economic integration of a metropolitan or a micropolitan statistical area is operationalized using what we believe is an outdated, monocentric perspective on functional spatial structure: one that fixates solely on inward and reverse commuting. We propose a new spatial optimization model for delineating CBSAs that can better account for polycentric urban structure by considering all intercounty commuting linkages. Our model seeks to find the boundaries that maximize the containment of entire webs of intra-CBSA intercounty commuting. We apply the proposed method to delineate alternative sets of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas for comparison with the federal government's currently defined (2010 Office of Management and Budget \{[\}OMB] standards) official CBSAs.},

Maps provide visually what tables and other graphics cannot: a picture of the data, their distribution over geographic areas, and a means for interpreting the data shown by color, symbology, or explanation provided as annotations or as part of the map legend. The value of maps in enhancing an understanding of census data is well established as demonstrated by their frequent use in the media following the release of census data products. Mapping census data is common throughout government, academia, and the private sector. Casual users of maps of statistical data may not look past what is interesting visually to analyze the underlying data that a map depicts. However, that does not absolve the mapmaker of the responsibility for informing users of the statistical qualities associated with the mapped values. The Census Bureau set new standards for communicating the statistical qualities of estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) by including information on the level of sampling error (specifically, margins of error) associated with every ACS estimate. Now, efforts are underway to develop an operational tool that will make it possible for geographic information systems (GIS) users to},

  abstract = {The paper focuses on the relation of social capital and regional innovative capability. It examines the social nature of the innovative processes placing demands on the regional innovation environment and underlining the importance of social capital. The paper analyses the concept of social capital and problems connected to it. It introduces a conception of social capital defining it functionally as a field-specific social resource of an actor. This conception is applied to analyse social capital as a central element in enhancing regional innovative capability. The relation between social capital and innovation capability is not, however, without problems. This still controversial relation is discussed.},

This indicates significant variation between places in the relationship between individual and area characteristics which influence the probability of volunteering. Then we proceed to show how this can be used to generate predictions of the variations between places in a number of aspects of the social environment.

While satellite-based earth observation has proven to be of vast scientific value, these data are typically confined to recent decades of observation and often lack important thematic detail. Here, we advance in this arena by constructing new spatially-explicit settlement data for the United States that extend back to the early nineteenth century, and is consistently enumerated at fine spatial and temporal granularity (i.e., 250m spatial, and 5 a temporal resolution). We create these time series using a large, novel building stock database to extract and map retrospective, fine-grained spatial distributions of built-up properties in the conterminous United States from 1810 to 2015. From our data extraction, we analyse and publish a series of gridded geospatial datasets that enable novel retrospective historical analysis of the built environment at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. The datasets are available at  https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/hisdacus  (Uhl and Leyk, 2020a, b, c, d).},

The social sciences have developed weak analyses of the more distant yet intermittent connections that hold social life together. It is shown that intermittent bodily copresence resulting from travel and occasioned encounters is critically significant for social life. The importance of such copresence is characteristic even of virtual communities and of far-flung diasporic communities. But it is also shown that new 'inhabiting machines' are emerging, machines that undermine the distinction between 'transportation' and 'communications'. These new machinic hybrids are reconfiguring relations at a distance and constitute something of an epochal shift. Although there have always been complex connections of presence and absence, the current century seems to be ushering in some exceptional changes in those recurrent patterns of presence and absence, through our dwelling within an increasingly populous world of inhabiting machines.},

The social sciences have developed weak analyses of the more distant yet intermittent connections that hold social life together. It is shown that intermittent bodily copresence resulting from travel and occasioned encounters is critically significant for social life. The importance of such copresence is characteristic even of virtual communities and of far-flung diasporic communities. But it is also shown that new 'inhabiting machines' are emerging, machines that undermine the distinction between 'transportation' and 'communications'. These new machinic hybrids are reconfiguring relations at a distance and constitute something of an epochal shift. Although there have always been complex connections of presence and absence, the current century seems to be ushering in some exceptional changes in those recurrent patterns of presence and absence, through our dwelling within an increasingly populous world of inhabiting machines.},

GAO was asked to examine poverty and race in schools and efforts by the Departments of Education and Justice, which are responsible for enforcing federal civil rights laws prohibiting racial discrimination against students. This report examined (1) how the percentage of schools with high percentages of poor and Black or Hispanic students has changed over time and the characteristics of these schools, (2) why and how selected school districts have implemented actions to increase student diversity, and (3) the extent to which the Departments of Education and Justice have taken actions to identify and address issues related to racial discrimination in schools. GAO analyzed Education data for school years 2000-01 to 2013-14 (most recent available); reviewed applicable federal laws, regulations, and agency documents; and interviewed federal officials, civil rights and academic subject matter specialists, and school district officials in three states, selected to provide geographic diversity and examples of actions to diversify.},

  abstract = {Although the effects of population stability on electoral turnout rates are relatively well-known, the role of the characteristics of hosting cities in this relationship are largely unexplored. This paper analyzes the moderating effect of city size on the relationship between residential mobility and electoral turnout. Residential mobility is known to depress civic engagement and political participation at the local level. We argue that this relationship is moderated by the characteristics of hosting cities, approached through city size. The main argument is that smaller cities offer better chances to newcomers to reconnect to the political process. Working with census data from more than 5500 different municipalities, we find that city size has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between residential mobility and turnout. On the one hand, residential mobility and city size do have separate negative effects on turnout, but on the other, the expected negative effects of mobility on turnout are actually stronger in larger than in smaller municipalities. Results indicate, therefore, that smaller communities not only provide more favorable conditions for political participation to their life-long residents, but they also seem to offer newcomers better chances to reconnect to the political process than larger cities.},

However, selection looms large in this line of research and it has been repeatedly argued that estimates of neighbourhood effects are biased as people non-randomly select into neighbourhoods based on their preferences, income, and the availability of alternative housing. We propose a two-step framework to help disentangle selection processes in the relationship between neighbourhood deprivation and earnings. We first model neighbourhood selection using a discrete choice framework and derive correction components to adjust parameter estimates in a subsequent neighbourhood effects model for the unequal probability that an individual 'chooses' to live in a particular area. Applying this technique to administrative data from the Netherlands, we find significant interactions between personal and neighbourhood characteristics in the selection model. This confirms individual differences in neighbourhood preferences; individuals non-randomly select into neighbourhoods. The baseline neighbourhood effects model reveals a significant effect of average neighbourhood income on individual income. When we include correction components for the differential sorting of individuals into specific neighbourhoods, the effect of neighbourhood income diminishes, but remains significant. These results suggest that researchers need to be attuned to the role of selection bias when assessing the role of neighbourhood effects on individual outcomes. Perhaps more importantly, the strong, persistent effect of neighbourhood deprivation on subsequent earnings suggests that neighbourhood effects reflect more than the shared characteristics of neighbourhood residents; place of residence partially determines economic well-being.},

We propose a two-step framework to disentangle selection processes in the relationship between neighborhood deprivation and earnings. We model neighborhood selection using a conditional logit model, from which we derive correction terms. Driven by the recognition that most households prefer certain types of neighborhoods rather than specific areas, we employ a principle components analysis to reduce these terms into eight correction components. We use these to adjust parameter estimates from a model of subsequent neighborhood effects on individual income for the unequal probability that a household chooses to live in a particular type of neighborhood. We apply this technique to administrative data from the Netherlands. After we adjust for the differential sorting of households into certain types of neighborhoods, the effect of neighborhood income on individual income diminishes but remains significant.

A data set is constructed locating within-and between-group portions of male wage, female wage, and household income inequality from nine waves of the inte-grated public use microdata series from the U.S. census in 722 tempo-rally stable geographical units that cover the entire contiguous United States. Results from heteroscedastic and multilevel repeated-measures regression models reveal that within-group inequality follows eco-nomic development along a U-shaped pattern and that the well-established curvilinear relationship between development and inequal-ity occurs specifically through the within-group portion of wages and incomes. Other factors{\textemdash}including sector change, occupational task concentration, educational expansion, urbanization, and deinstitu-tionalization{\textemdash}contribute to explain the association between within-group inequality and economic development.

The most common of these constraints include contiguity, population equality, and compactness. We propose an algorithm to address this problem based on multi-objective optimization. The hybrid algorithm we propose combines the use of the well-known Pareto-based NSGA-II technique with a novel variable neighbourhood search strategy. A new ad-hoc initialization method is also proposed. Finally, new specific genetic operators that ensure the compliance of the contiguity constraint are introduced. The experimental results we present, which are performed considering five US states, clearly show the appropriateness of the proposed hybrid algorithm for the redistricting problem. We give evidence of the fact that our method produces better and more reliable solutions with respect to those returned by the state-of-the-art methods.},

This decline has been particularly stark in rural areas, though it extends across the rural{\textendash}urban spectrum. An associated decline in relational lending is hypothesized to drive a reduction in several indicators of rural resilience. Given the association between the presence of local banks and positive economic resiliency indicators, this research takes a natural next step by using demand threshold techniques to measure the impact of local bank presence on the thresholds for manufacturing and retail businesses in specific industries. We present comparisons to the influence of local (single-commuting zone) and regional (multi-commuting zone) bank presence on both local and regional businesses to account for firm extent. Findings indicate that local banks influence establishments' demand thresholds, though the size of the relationship varies by the establishment's industry and firm extent, rather than rurality, as previous evidence suggests. Given these findings on the value of local banks, a resultant policy question relates to the feasibility of the preservation of local banks and if local factors can contribute to their resilience. Thus, the paper concludes with a second threshold analysis comparing the impact of local factors on the count of local and regional bank establishments themselves.},

  abstract = {This theme issue of Environment and Planning A builds on the analytic framework elaborated by Wacquant in Urban Outcasts (Polity Press, 2008) and on the activities of the Leverhulme Network on Advanced Urban Marginality to synthesize and stimulate inquiries into the triadic nexus of symbolic space, social space, and physical space at the lower end of the urban spectrum. The concept of territorial stigmatization weds with Bourdieu's theory of `symbolic power' Goffman's model of the management of `spoiled identity' to capture how the blemish of place impacts the residents of disparaged districts, the surrounding denizens and commercial operators, street-level public bureaucracies, specialists in cultural production (such as journalists, scholars, and politicians), and state officials and policies. Spatial taint is a novel and distinctive phenomenon that crystallized at century's end along with the dissolution of the neighborhoods of relegation emblematic of the Fordist{\textendash}Keynesian phase of industrial capitalism. It differs from the traditional topography of disrepute in the industrial city in that it has become autonomized, nationalized and democratized, equated with social disintegration, racialized through selective accentuation, and it elicits revulsion often leading to punitive corrective measures. The sociosymbolic strategies fashioned by the residents of defamed quarters to cope with spatial denigration span a panoply ranging from submission to defiance, and their adoption depends on position and trajectory in social and physical space. Territorial stigmatization is not a static condition or a neutral process, but a consequential and injurious form of action through collective representation fastened on place. By probing how it operates in different urban settings and political formations, the contributors to this issue advance our empirical understanding of the role of symbolic structures in the production of inequality and marginality in the city. They also suggest the need for public policies designed to reduce, not only the burden of material deprivation, but also the press of symbolic domination in the\,metropolis.},

We analyze male lip cancer incidence data collected in Scotland over the period 1975-1980, and outline a number of problems with previous analyses of these data. In disease mapping studies, hierarchical models can provide robust estimation of area-level risk parameters, though care is required in the choice of covariate model, and it is important to assess the sensitivity of estimates to the spatial model chosen, and to the prior specifications on the variance parameters. Spatial ecological regression is a far more hazardous enterprise for two reasons. First, there is always the possibility of ecological bias, and this can only be alleviated by the inclusion of individual-level data. For the Scottish data, we show that the previously used mean model has limited interpretation from an individual perspective. Second, when residual spatial dependence is modeled, and if the exposure has spatial structure, then estimates of exposure association parameters will change when compared with those obtained from the independence across space model, and the data alone cannot choose the form and extent of spatial correlation that is appropriate.},

  abstract = {Vulnerability resulting from debt is part and parcel of the risk society and a salient characteristic of current neoliberal times under financialized global capitalism. Rising indebtedness increases the susceptibility of homeowners to housing and labor market restructuring, and if the degree of leverage is very high, can threaten the solvency, living standards, and social stability of local communities. However, very little is understood regarding how levels of household indebtedness are spatially distributed within or across cities, and how private debt maps onto the geography of race, class, housing, urban form, and other social variables, especially outside of the United States. It remains unknown whether and how higher and unsustainable levels of indebtedness might be associated with urban growth, decline, suburbanization, gentrification, immigration, racialization, and/or greying. This article examines the spatial distribution of household debt in Canadian cities at multiple scales of analysis. It analyzes how levels of household debt relate to a number of key socio-demographic and housing variables from the census, including those related to changes occurring over the 2000s. It simultaneously models the geography of debt at the metropolitan and neighborhood scales using multi-level hierarchical linear modeling methods, and in doing so, it identifies some key drivers and correlates of household debt and the scales at which they operate. The article concludes by discussing the implications of the empirical findings for understanding the role of the emerging urban debtscape in the restructuring of the social geography of the city.},

The commonly used {\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttildelow}metropolitan/non-metropolitan{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark} distinction obscures important socioeconomic differences among metropolitan areas, making our understanding of the geography of poverty imprecise. Given the number and concentration of poor people living in mixed-rural and rural counties in metropolitan regions, researchers and policy-makers need to pay more nuanced attention to the opportunities and constraints such individuals face. A cross-classification of the Office of Management and Budget{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s metro system with a nuanced RUDC scheme is the most effective for revealing the geographical complexities of poverty within metropolitan areas.},

  abstract = {Since the U.S. Supreme Court's Davis v. Bandemer ruling in 1986, partisan gerrymandering for statewide electoral advantage has been held to be justiciable. The existing Supreme Court standard, culminating in Vieth v. Jubelirer and LULAC v. Perry, holds that a test for gerrymandering should demonstrate both intents and effects and that partisan gerrymandering may be recognizable by its asymmetry: for a given distribution of popular votes, if the parties switch places in popular vote, the numbers of seats will change in an unequal fashion. However, the asymmetry standard is only a broad statement of principle, and no analytical method for assessing asymmetry has yet been held by the Supreme Court to be manageable. This Article proposes three statistical tests to reliably assess asymmetry in state-level districting schemes: (1) an unrepresentative distortion in the number of seats won based on expectations from nationwide district characteristics; (2) a discrepancy in winning vote margins between the two parties; and (3) the construction of reliable wins for the party in charge of redistricting, as measured by either the difference between mean and median vote share, or an unusually even distribution of votes across districts. The first test relies on computer simulation to estimate appropriate levels of representation for a given level of popular vote and provides a way to measure the effects of a gerrymander. The second and third tests, which can be used to help evaluate redistricting intent, rely on well-established statistical principles and can be carried out using a hand calculator without examination of maps or redistricting procedures. I apply these standards to a variety of districting schemes, starting from the original "Gerry-mander" of 1812, up to modern cases. In post-2010 congressional elections, partisan gerrymandering in a handful of states generated effects that are larger than the total nationwide effect of population clustering. By applying these standards in two recent cases, I show that Arizona legislative districts (Harris v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission) fail to qualify as a partisan gerrymander, but Maryland's congressional districts (Shapiro v. McManus) do. I propose that an intents-and-effects standard based on these tests is robust enough to mitigate the need to demonstrate predominant partisan intent. The three statistical standards offered here add to the judge's toolkit for rapidly and rigorously identifying the partisan consequences of redistricting.},

  abstract = {Background:~         Geocoding is often used in epidemiologic studies to map residences with geographic information systems (GIS). The accuracy of the method is usually not determined.         Methods:~         We collected global positioning system (GPS) measurements at homes in a case{\textendash}control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Iowa. We geocoded the addresses by 2 methods: (1) in-house, using ArcView 3.2 software and the U.S. Census Bureau TIGER2000 street database; and (2) automated geocoding by a commercial firm. We calculated the distance between the geocoded and GPS location (positional error) overall and separately for homes within towns and outside (rural). We evaluated the error in classifying homes with respect to their proximity to crop fields.         Results:~         Overall, the majority of homes were geocoded with positional errors of less than 100 m by both methods (ArcView/TIGER 2000, median = 62 m [interquartile range = 39{\textendash}103]; commercial firm, median = 61 m [interquartile range = 35{\textendash}137]). For town residences, the percent geocoded with errors of {$\leq$}100 m was 81\% for ArcView/TIGER 2000 and 84\% for the commercial firm. For rural residences, a smaller percent of addresses were geocoded with this level of accuracy, especially by the commercial firm (ArcView/TIGER 2000, 56\%; commercial firm, 28\%). Geocoding errors affected our classification of homes according to their proximity to agricultural fields at 100 m, but not at greater distances (250{\textendash}500 m).         Conclusions:~         Our results indicate greater positional errors for rural addresses compared with town addresses. Using a commercial firm did not improve accuracy compared with our in-house method. The effect of geocoding errors on exposure classification will depend on the spatial variation of the exposure being studied.},

Through interviews and a review of primary documents, we uncover a network of private consultants who had prior experience shepherding federal urban renewal dollars to cities and who later mobilized concerns around the 1970s deindustrialization crisis to steer the use of property tax incentives from job creation/retention to real estate development.},

  abstract = {High quality election districting plans provide representation to the broadest array of demographic groups possible. In rapidly diversifying countries such as the United States this goal will become of ever greater importance in the future. The quality and legality of districting plans are typically evaluated on the basis of a long list of criteria including contiguity, compactness, population equality, racial equity, the avoidance of splitting local government subdivisions, and the maintenance of communities of interest, among others. Do these criteria facilitate or inhibit the creation of districting plans facilitating high quality representation? Using the perspective of social justice, this paper evaluates current traditional redistricting evaluative criteria based upon the clarity of their goals and whether there are generally accepted methods for judging a plan's quality. It finds that the goals of some criteria are ill-defined with others having no accepted protocols to judge a plan's fidelity to these goals. It also argues that political geographers can have an important role in further refining the purpose and measurement of the current evaluative criteria used in the redistricting process.},

  abstract = {Abstract   Demographic and socio-economic information provided by the American Community Survey (ACS) have been increasingly relied upon in many planning and decision making contexts due to its timely and current estimates. However, ACS estimates are well known to be subject to larger sampling errors with a much smaller sample size compared with the decennial census data. To support the assessment of the reliability of ACS estimates, the US Census Bureau publishes a margin of error at the 90\% confidence level alongside each estimate. While data error or uncertainty in ACS estimates has been widely acknowledged, little has been done to devise methods accounting for such error or uncertainty. This article focuses on addressing ACS data uncertainty issues in choropleth mapping, one of the most widely used methods to visually explore spatial distributions of demographic and socio-economic data. A new classification method is developed to explicitly integrate errors of estimation in the assessment of within-class variation and the associated groupings. The proposed method is applied to mapping the 2009{\textendash}2013 ACS estimates of median household income at various scales. Results are compared with those generated using existing classification methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new classification scheme.},

The paper focuses on the fourth domain. Sample surveys of households in the five case study communities used a survey instrument with scaled items to measure four aspects of social capital - formal norms, informal norms, formal structures and informal structures - that embrace the concepts of trust, reciprocity, bonds, bridges, links and networks in the interaction of individuals with their community inherent in the notion social capital. Exploratory principal components analysis is used to identify factors that measure those aspects of social and institutional capital, while a confirmatory analysis based on Cronbach's alpha explores the robustness of the measures. Four primary scales and 15 subscales are identified when defining the domain of social and institutional capital. Further analysis reveals that two measures - anomie, and perceived quality of life and wellbeing - relate to certain primary scales of social capital.},

I argue that Racial and Ethnic Inequality does not fully explain racial inequality in poverty and affluence{\textemdash}particularly among black Americans and American Indians compared to white Americans{\textemdash}because the manuscript follows conventional approaches to the study of racial inequality that obscure racial domination and oppression in the US. These conventional approaches include (1) highlighting the racial gap in a given outcome without conceptualizing and historicizing the social construction of race, (2) theorizing human capital as race-neutral to account for racial inequality, and (3) employing data analyses that reflect analytic bifurcation, which treat racial groups as real essences, monolithic, and position white Americans as the standard against which people of color are measured. These conventional approaches are not unique to Racial and Ethnic Inequality. My goal is to use Racial and Ethnic Inequality as an illustrative example of how conventional approaches address the idea of ``race'' in sociological research, and whether these approaches provide readers with the most optimal ways to understand racial inequality in the US. I make several recommendations to move research on racial inequality forward. My intention is to spark a conversation about what can be considered ``best practices'' in addressing the role of race in racial inequality research.},

We present racial stratification as an alternative perspective emphasizing the social construction of race and how race contributes to the unequal distribution of resources. To illustrate the link between racial stratification and poverty, we rely on risk research and conceptualize risk in terms of prevalences (the percentage of people with risks) and penalties (the probability of poverty associated with risks). We assess whether family structure and risks intersect by racialized groups, and if so, whether the penalties for risks among Black and Latinx mothers, relative to white mothers, converge (i.e., smaller gap in penalties) or diverge (i.e., larger gap in penalties). Using panel data, our results revealed Black mothers had higher risk prevalence than both Latinx and white mothers. Moreover, a dramatic divergence in the penalties for risks emerged between racialized groups whereby Black and Latinx mothers experience greater disadvantage from risks than white mothers, regardless of family structure. We conclude family structure is not only an oversimplified explanation but also contributes to obscuring structural and systemic sources of racial inequality in poverty.},

  abstract = {Housing wealth is the largest component of wealth for a majority of Swedish households. Whereas investments in housing are merely defined by income, the returns on this investment (capital gains) are dependent on local housing market dynamics. Since the 1990s, local housing market dynamics in Swedish cities have been altered by the upswing in levels of socio-spatial inequality. The simultaneous up- and downgrading of neighbourhoods is reflected in house price developments and exacerbates the magnitude of capital gains and losses. This article proposes that the selective redirection of housing pathways that causes an upswing in socio-spatial inequality translates into an uneven distribution of capital gains as well. A sequence analysis of the housing pathways of one Swedish birth cohort (1970{\textendash}1975), based on population-wide register data (GeoSweden), is used to explain differences in capital gains between different social groups in the period 1995{\textendash}2010. The results indicate higher capital gains for individ...},

We question previous work for two reasons: the use of study areas that overbound or underbound sprawl landscapes, and the failure to account for land unavailable for development. We formulate ``extended urban areas,'' based on housing density and commuting patterns and argue that they represent a preferable geographic basis for measuring sprawl. We operationalize with satellite imagery a way for measuring land unavailable for development in these areas. We then compute five measures of urban development using the National Land Cover Data Base and decennial census data to assess the extent of sprawl in the extended urban areas of Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Los Angeles, and Washington. Our sensitivity analyses reveal that the measurement of sprawl critically depends on which land area forms the basis of the analysis, and, to a lesser degree, how one accounts for land unava...},

We examine several of the most prominently made assertions about manufacturing decline and its consequences for deindustrializing metropolitan areas and find not all of them supported by the data. In particular, we find that, given their industrial structure some of these areas performed better than expected, that long-term economic distress was not inevitable, that manufacturing remains an important component in many metropolitan area economies, and that much of the growth in the service sector is based upon or complementary to the existence of manufacturing. We also find that low growth in these deindustrialized areas was due more to these regions losing their market share of individual industries to other U.S. regions than it was to the areas having an adverse industrial structure, that economies that were more diversified in 1980 did not have greater employment growth from 1980-2011 than those that were less diverse, and that declines in manufacturing did result in a movement of jobs from relatively high-wage to relatively low-wage industries and thus a decline in earnings per jobs.},

Between 1990 and 2010, the Office of Management and Budget brought ninety-one metropolitan areas into existence and altered the boundaries of almost half of the others. Because metropolitan area reclassification not only creates new metropolitan areas but also frequently leads to the incorporation of peripheral, majority-White, counties, this article analyzes the effects of these territorial alterations on aggregate metropolitan racial diversity, changes in the aggregate counts of White people in metropolitan areas, and differences in the counts of census tracts in which White people form significant majorities. Using census data from 1990, 2000, and 2010, we demonstrate that the 2010 reclassification produces metropolitan areas that are relatively more White and relatively less diverse than those based on the 1990 definitions. In addition, using 2010 metropolitan boundaries rather than those from 1990 boosts the counts of predominantly White census tracts at the expense of other types. The reclassification process appears superficially to be race neutral, because it entails the periodic evaluation of intercounty economic linkages. We point out, however, that racialized residential processes help forge these new patterns of economic and social interaction.},

While existing studies provide marginal values for rail access in the real estate market, little is known about homeowners' happiness evaluation of such public investment. Using large-scale micro survey data, this paper estimates, in a difference-in-difference framework, the effects on homeowners' happiness about public commuting and other residential realms of a transport improvement that altered the residence-station distance for some households, whilst leaving others unaffected. The estimation accounts for the endogeneity between the residential location choice and transport choice by using non-market (fang gai) housing with pre-determined residential location. It is found that better rail access not only provides sizeable happiness about public commuting to Beijing homeowners, but also affects their happiness in other residential realms. This finding adds to the evidence that public investment has an important role to play in influencing homeowners' living experience.},

In doing so, it also explores the contribution of activity spaces to opportunities for diverse social contact. The findings show that the exposure to opportunities for diverse social contact measured by MPA data is generally higher than what is implied by residential census data, especially in areas of high residential segregation in the city. Further, measures using MPA data reveal more spatiotemporal heterogeneity of exposure than that implied by the residential context.},

  abstract = {Twitter data are becoming a Big Data stream and have drawn multidisciplinary interests to study population characteristics and social problems that cannot be measured well by traditional surveys. However, the use of Twitter data has been strongly resisted because of concerns about the representativeness of the population as we know little about the demographic characters of the users. It is critical to evaluate the extent to which Twitter users represent the population across different demographic groups. This study evaluates the representativeness and examines the geographic distributions of Twitter user population and its correspondence to the real population. By estimating Twitter user demographics for the contiguous U.S. in 2014, the preliminary results revealed both over- and under-representation of certain demographic groups against the real population at county-level. A representation index is used to assess the representativeness of Twitter samples geographically, which may help further studies to identify the determinants of biases.},

The quality of geocoding and its effect on spatial analysis have received some attention in the literature, in particular in the field of health. This article reviews the foundation of geocoding and presents a framework for evaluating geocoding quality. Errors introduced by street gecoding include incompleteness, positional error, and incorrect assignment to geographic units. A review of empirical studies suggests that these errors are neither small nor random in nature and that substantial bias may be introduced in spatial analysis that employs the results of geocoding. Several alternatives have also emerged, including the use of address points and parcels, and these are gradually becoming more widely used. Several areas for future research on geocoding have been identified: (i) refinements of address data models to incorporate complex addressing situations; (ii) development of error propagation techniques to determine the level of geocoding quality required for a particular analysis scenario; (iii) development of measures of reliability for geocoding results; (iv) comparative analysis of geocoding quality across different jurisdictions; and (v) validation of online geocoding services and volunteered geographic information.},

We used four different geocoding techniques for comparison to establish the repeatability of geocoding, and an analysis of proximity to major roads to determine bias and error in environmental exposure assessment.ResultsResults indicate that the positional error in geocoding of schools is very substantial: We found that the 95\% root mean square error was 196 m using street centerlines, 306 m using TIGER roads, and 210 and 235 m for two commercial geocoding firms. We found bias and error in proximity analysis to major roads to be unacceptably large at distances of {$<$} 500 m. Bias and error are introduced by lack of positional accuracy and lack of repeatability of geocoding of school locations.ConclusionsThese results suggest that typical geocoding is insufficient for fine-scale analysis of school locations and more accurate alternatives need to be considered.},

The BISG proxy predicts the reported race/ethnicity the best as judged by prediction bias, correlation coefficient, and discriminatory power. In assessing fair lending risks where classification of race/ethnicity is called for, we propose the BISG maximum classification, which produces a more accurate estimation of mortgage pricing disparities than the current practices. The above conclusions withhold various robustness tests. Additional analysis is performed to assess the proxies on nonmortgage credits by leveraging consumer credit bureau data.},

To do so, the differential effects of local and regional unemployment on the likelihood that individual women and men are unemployed and differences in the underlying patterns of unemployment by gender are explored. Using a unique tabulation of micro data for labor market areas, two series of multilevel models for women and men are fit. The multilevel model results suggest that regional variation in unemployment is more evident for men than for women and, contrary to the empirical evidence, the underlying pattern of unemployment for men is more clustered than for women. The article concludes by discussing the policy implications of the finding that most of the variation in labor market outcomes for both women and men is attributable to individual-level rather than labor market area-level characteristics.},

  abstract = {This research evaluates the performance of areal interpolation coupled with dasymetric refinement to estimate different demographic attributes, namely population sub-groups based on race, age structure and urban residence, within consistent census tract boundaries from 1990 to 2010 in Massachusetts. The creation of such consistent estimates facilitates the study of the nuanced micro-scale evolution of different aspects of population, which is impossible using temporally incompatible small-area census geographies from different points in time. Various unexplored ancillary variables, including the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), the National Land-Cover Database (NLCD), parcels, building footprints and the proprietary ZTRAX{\textregistered} dataset are utilized for dasymetric refinement prior to areal interpolation to examine their effectiveness in improving the accuracy of multi-temporal population estimates. Different areal interpolation methods including Areal Weighting (AW), Target Density Weighting (TDW), Expectation Maximization (EM) and its data-extended approach are coupled with different dasymetric refinement scenarios based on these ancillary variables. The resulting consistent small area estimates of white and black subpopulations, people of age 18{\textendash}65 and urban population show that dasymetrically refined areal interpolation is particularly effective when the analysis spans a longer time period (1990{\textendash}2010 instead of 2000{\textendash}2010) and the enumerated population is sufficiently large (e.g., counts of white vs. black). The results also demonstrate that current census-defined urban areas overestimate the spatial distribution of urban population and dasymetrically refined areal interpolation improves estimates of urban population. Refined TDW using building footprints or the ZTRAX{\textregistered} dataset outperforms all other methods. The implementation of areal interpolation enriched by dasymetric refinement represents a promising strategy to create more reliable multi-temporal and consistent estimates of different population subgroups and thus demographic compositions. This methodological foundation has the potential to advance micro-scale modeling of various subpopulations, particularly urban population to inform studies of urbanization and population change over time as well as future population projections.},
